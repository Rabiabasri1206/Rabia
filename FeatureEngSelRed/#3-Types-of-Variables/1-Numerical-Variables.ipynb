    "## What is a Variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable is any characteristic, number, or quantity that can be measured or counted. They are called 'variables' because the value they take may vary, and it usually does. The following are examples of variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Age (21, 35, 62, ...)\n",
    "- Gender (male, female)\n",
    "- Income (GBP 20000, GBP 35000, GBP 45000, ...)\n",
    "- House price (GBP 350000, GBP 570000, ...)\n",
    "- Country of birth (China, Russia, Costa Rica, ...)\n",
    "- Eye colour (brown, green, blue, ...)\n",
    "- Vehicle make (Ford, Volkswagen, ...)\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='type.JPG'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Most variables in a data set can be classified into one of two major types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Numerical variables** \n",
    "- **Categorical variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "===================================================================================\n",
    "\n",
    "## Numerical Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "The values of a numerical variable are numbers. They can be further classified into:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Discrete variables** \n",
    "- **Continuous variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discrete Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "In a discrete variable, the values are whole numbers (counts). For example, the number of items bought by a customer in a supermarket is discrete. The customer can buy 1, 25, or 50 items, but not 3.7 items. It is always a round number. The following are examples of discrete variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Number of active bank accounts of a borrower (1, 4, 7, ...)\n",
    "- Number of pets in the family\n",
    "- Number of children in the family\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Continuous Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable that may contain any value within a range is continuous. For example, the total amount paid by a customer in a supermarket is continuous. The customer can pay, GBP 20.5, GBP 13.10, GBP 83.20 and so on. Other examples of continuous variables are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- House price (in principle, it can take any value) (GBP 350000, 57000, 100000, ...)\n",
    "- Time spent surfing a website (3.4 seconds, 5.10 seconds, ...)\n",
    "- Total debt as percentage of total income in the last month (0.2, 0.001, 0, 0.75, ...)\n",
    "\n",
    "=============================================================================\n",
    "\n",
    "## In this demo: Peer to peer lending (Finance)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, we will use data from the peer-o-peer finance company **Lending Club** to inspect discrete and continuous numerical variables"
