      "My kinsman and myself were returning to Calcutta from our Puja trip when\n",
      "we met the man in a train. From his dress and bearing we took him at\n",
      "first for an up-country Mahomedan, but we were puzzled as we heard him\n",
      "talk. He discoursed upon all subjects so confidently that you might\n",
      "think the Disposer of All Things consulted him at all times in all that\n",
      "He did. Hitherto we had been perfectly happy, as we did not know\n",
      "that secret and unheard-of forces were at work, that the Russians had\n",
      "advanced close to us, that the English had deep and secret policies,\n",
      "that confusion among the native chiefs had come to a head. But our\n",
      "newly-acquired friend said with a sly smile: \"There happen more things\n",
      "in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are reported in your newspapers.\" As\n",
      "we had never stirred out of our homes before, the demeanour of the man\n",
      "struck us dumb with wonder. Be the topic ever so trivial, he would quote\n",
      "science, or comment on the Vedas, or repeat quatrains from some Persian\n",
      "poet; and as we had no pretence to a knowledge of science or the Vedas\n",
      "or Persian, our admiration for him went on increasing, and my kinsman,\n",
      "a theosophist, was firmly convinced that our fellow-passenger must\n",
      "have been supernaturally inspired by some strange \"magnetism\" or \"occult\n",
      "power,\" by an \"astral body\" or something of that kind. He listened\n",
      "to the tritest saying that fell from the lips of our extraordinary\n",
      "companion with devotional rapture, and secretly took down notes of his\n",
      "conversation. I fancy that the extraordinary man saw this, and was a\n",
      "little pleased with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the train reached the junction, we assembled in the waiting room\n",
      "for the connection. It was then 10 P.M., and as the train, we heard, was\n",
      "likely to be very late, owing to something wrong in the lines, I spread\n",
      "my bed on the table and was about to lie down for a comfortable doze,\n",
      "when the extraordinary person deliberately set about spinning the\n",
      "following yarn. Of course, I could get no sleep that night.\n",
      "\n",
      "When, owing to a disagreement about some questions of administrative\n",
      "policy, I threw up my post at Junagarh, and entered the service of\n",
      "the Nizam of Hydria, they appointed me at once, as a strong young man,\n",
      "collector of cotton duties at Barich.\n",
      "\n",
      "Barich is a lovely place. The Susta \"chatters over stony ways and\n",
      "babbles on the pebbles,\" tripping, like a skilful dancing girl, in\n",
      "through the woods below the lonely hills. A flight of 150 steps rises\n",
      "from the river, and above that flight, on the river's brim and at the\n",
      "foot of the hills, there stands a solitary marble palace. Around it\n",
      "there is no habitation of man--the village and the cotton mart of Barich\n",
      "being far off.\n",
      "\n",
      "About 250 years ago the Emperor Mahmud Shah II. had built this lonely\n",
      "palace for his pleasure and luxury. In his days jets of rose-water\n",
      "spurted from its fountains, and on the cold marble floors of its\n",
      "spray-cooled rooms young Persian damsels would sit, their hair\n",
      "dishevelled before bathing, and, splashing their soft naked feet in the\n",
      "clear water of the reservoirs, would sing, to the tune of the guitar,\n",
      "the ghazals of their vineyards.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fountains play no longer; the songs have ceased; no longer do\n",
      "snow-white feet step gracefully on the snowy marble. It is but the vast\n",
      "and solitary quarters of cess-collectors like us, men oppressed with\n",
      "solitude and deprived of the society of women. Now, Karim Khan, the old\n",
      "clerk of my office, warned me repeatedly not to take up my abode there.\n",
      "\"Pass the day there, if you like,\" said he, \"but never stay the night.\"\n",
      "I passed it off with a light laugh. The servants said that they would\n",
      "work till dark and go away at night. I gave my ready assent. The house\n",
      "had such a bad name that even thieves would not venture near it after\n",
      "dark.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first the solitude of the deserted palace weighed upon me like a\n",
      "nightmare. I would stay out, and work hard as long as possible, then\n",
      "return home at night jaded and tired, go to bed and fall asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before a week had passed, the place began to exert a weird fascination\n",
      "upon me. It is difficult to describe or to induce people to believe;\n",
      "but I felt as if the whole house was like a living organism slowly and\n",
      "imperceptibly digesting me by the action of some stupefying gastric\n",
      "juice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps the process had begun as soon as I set my foot in the house, but\n",
      "I distinctly remember the day on which I first was conscious of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the beginning of summer, and the market being dull I had no work\n",
      "to do. A little before sunset I was sitting in an arm-chair near the\n",
      "water's edge below the steps. The Susta had shrunk and sunk low; a broad\n",
      "patch of sand on the other side glowed with the hues of evening; on\n",
      "this side the pebbles at the bottom of the clear shallow waters were\n",
      "glistening. There was not a breath of wind anywhere, and the still air\n",
      "was laden with an oppressive scent from the spicy shrubs growing on the\n",
      "hills close by.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the sun sank behind the hill-tops a long dark curtain fell upon the\n",
      "stage of day, and the intervening hills cut short the time in which\n",
      "light and shade mingle at sunset. I thought of going out for a ride,\n",
      "and was about to get up when I heard a footfall on the steps behind. I\n",
      "looked back, but there was no one.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I sat down again, thinking it to be an illusion, I heard many\n",
      "footfalls, as if a large number of persons were rushing down the steps.\n",
      "A strange thrill of delight, slightly tinged with fear, passed through\n",
      "my frame, and though there was not a figure before my eyes, methought I\n",
      "saw a bevy of joyous maidens coming down the steps to bathe in the Susta\n",
      "in that summer evening. Not a sound was in the valley, in the river, or\n",
      "in the palace, to break the silence, but I distinctly heard the maidens'\n",
      "gay and mirthful laugh, like the gurgle of a spring gushing forth in a\n",
      "hundred cascades, as they ran past me, in quick playful pursuit of\n",
      "each other, towards the river, without noticing me at all. As they were\n",
      "invisible to me, so I was, as it were, invisible to them. The river was\n",
      "perfectly calm, but I felt that its still, shallow, and clear waters\n",
      "were stirred suddenly by the splash of many an arm jingling with\n",
      "bracelets, that the girls laughed and dashed and spattered water at one\n",
      "another, that the feet of the fair swimmers tossed the tiny waves up in\n",
      "showers of pearl.\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt a thrill at my heart--I cannot say whether the excitement was due\n",
      "to fear or delight or curiosity. I had a strong desire to see them more\n",
      "clearly, but naught was visible before me; I thought I could catch all\n",
      "that they said if I only strained my ears; but however hard I strained\n",
      "them, I heard nothing but the chirping of the cicadas in the woods. It\n",
      "seemed as if a dark curtain of 250 years was hanging before me, and I\n",
      "would fain lift a corner of it tremblingly and peer through, though the\n",
      "assembly on the other side was completely enveloped in darkness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The oppressive closeness of the evening was broken by a sudden gust of\n",
      "wind, and the still surface of the Suista rippled and curled like the\n",
      "hair of a nymph, and from the woods wrapt in the evening gloom there\n",
      "came forth a simultaneous murmur, as though they were awakening from\n",
      "a black dream. Call it reality or dream, the momentary glimpse of that\n",
      "invisible mirage reflected from a far-off world, 250 years old, vanished\n",
      "in a flash. The mystic forms that brushed past me with their quick\n",
      "unbodied steps, and loud, voiceless laughter, and threw themselves into\n",
      "the river, did not go back wringing their dripping robes as they went.\n",
      "Like fragrance wafted away by the wind they were dispersed by a single\n",
      "breath of the spring.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I was filled with a lively fear that it was the Muse that had taken\n",
      "advantage of my solitude and possessed me--the witch had evidently come\n",
      "to ruin a poor devil like myself making a living by collecting cotton\n",
      "duties. I decided to have a good dinner--it is the empty stomach that\n",
      "all sorts of incurable diseases find an easy prey. I sent for my cook\n",
      "and gave orders for a rich, sumptuous moghlai dinner, redolent of spices\n",
      "and ghi.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next morning the whole affair appeared a queer fantasy. With a light\n",
      "heart I put on a sola hat like the sahebs, and drove out to my work. I\n",
      "was to have written my quarterly report that day, and expected to return\n",
      "late; but before it was dark I was strangely drawn to my house--by what\n",
      "I could not say--I felt they were all waiting, and that I should delay\n",
      "no longer. Leaving my report unfinished I rose, put on my sola hat, and\n",
      "startling the dark, shady, desolate path with the rattle of my carriage,\n",
      "I reached the vast silent palace standing on the gloomy skirts of the\n",
      "hills.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the first floor the stairs led to a very spacious hall, its roof\n",
      "stretching wide over ornamental arches resting on three rows of massive\n",
      "pillars, and groaning day and night under the weight of its own intense\n",
      "solitude. The day had just closed, and the lamps had not yet been\n",
      "lighted. As I pushed the door open a great bustle seemed to follow\n",
      "within, as if a throng of people had broken up in confusion, and rushed\n",
      "out through the doors and windows and corridors and verandas and rooms,\n",
      "to make its hurried escape.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I saw no one I stood bewildered, my hair on end in a kind of ecstatic\n",
      "delight, and a faint scent of attar and unguents almost effected by age\n",
      "lingered in my nostrils. Standing in the darkness of that vast desolate\n",
      "hall between the rows of those ancient pillars, I could hear the gurgle\n",
      "of fountains plashing on the marble floor, a strange tune on the guitar,\n",
      "the jingle of ornaments and the tinkle of anklets, the clang of bells\n",
      "tolling the hours, the distant note of nahabat, the din of the crystal\n",
      "pendants of chandeliers shaken by the breeze, the song of bulbuls from\n",
      "the cages in the corridors, the cackle of storks in the gardens, all\n",
      "creating round me a strange unearthly music.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I came under such a spell that this intangible, inaccessible,\n",
      "unearthly vision appeared to be the only reality in the world--and all\n",
      "else a mere dream. That I, that is to say, Srijut So-and-so, the eldest\n",
      "son of So-and-so of blessed memory, should be drawing a monthly salary\n",
      "of Rs. 450 by the discharge of my duties as collector of cotton duties,\n",
      "and driving in my dog-cart to my office every day in a short coat and\n",
      "soia hat, appeared to me to be such an astonishingly ludicrous illusion\n",
      "that I burst into a horse-laugh, as I stood in the gloom of that vast\n",
      "silent hall.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment my servant entered with a lighted kerosene lamp in his\n",
      "hand. I do not know whether he thought me mad, but it came back to me\n",
      "at once that I was in very deed Srijut So-and-so, son of So-and-so of\n",
      "blessed memory, and that, while our poets, great and small, alone could\n",
      "say whether inside of or outside the earth there was a region where\n",
      "unseen fountains perpetually played and fairy guitars, struck by\n",
      "invisible fingers, sent forth an eternal harmony, this at any rate was\n",
      "certain, that I collected duties at the cotton market at Banch, and\n",
      "earned thereby Rs. 450 per mensem as my salary. I laughed in great glee\n",
      "at my curious illusion, as I sat over the newspaper at my camp-table,\n",
      "lighted by the kerosene lamp.\n",
      "\n",
      "After I had finished my paper and eaten my moghlai dinner, I put out\n",
      "the lamp, and lay down on my bed in a small side-room. Through the\n",
      "open window a radiant star, high above the Avalli hills skirted by the\n",
      "darkness of their woods, was gazing intently from millions and\n",
      "millions of miles away in the sky at Mr. Collector lying on a humble\n",
      "camp-bedstead. I wondered and felt amused at the idea, and do not knew\n",
      "when I fell asleep or how long I slept; but I suddenly awoke with a\n",
      "start, though I heard no sound and saw no intruder--only the steady\n",
      "bright star on the hilltop had set, and the dim light of the new moon\n",
      "was stealthily entering the room through the open window, as if ashamed\n",
      "of its intrusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw nobody, but felt as if some one was gently pushing me. As I awoke\n",
      "she said not a word, but beckoned me with her five fingers bedecked with\n",
      "rings to follow her cautiously. I got up noiselessly, and, though not a\n",
      "soul save myself was there in the countless apartments of that deserted\n",
      "palace with its slumbering sounds and waiting echoes, I feared at every\n",
      "step lest any one should wake up. Most of the rooms of the palace were\n",
      "always kept closed, and I had never entered them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I followed breathless and with silent steps my invisible guide--I\n",
      "cannot now say where. What endless dark and narrow passages, what long\n",
      "corridors, what silent and solemn audience-chambers and close secret\n",
      "cells I crossed!\n",
      "\n",
      "Though I could not see my fair guide, her form was not invisible to my\n",
      "mind's eye,--an Arab girl, her arms, hard and smooth as marble, visible\n",
      "through her loose sleeves, a thin veil falling on her face from the\n",
      "fringe of her cap, and a curved dagger at her waist! Methought that one\n",
      "of the thousand and one Arabian Nights had been wafted to me from the\n",
      "world of romance, and that at the dead of night I was wending my way\n",
      "through the dark narrow alleys of slumbering Bagdad to a trysting-place\n",
      "fraught with peril.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last my fair guide stopped abruptly before a deep blue screen, and\n",
      "seemed to point to something below. There was nothing there, but a\n",
      "sudden dread froze the blood in my heart-methought I saw there on the\n",
      "floor at the foot of the screen a terrible negro eunuch dressed in rich\n",
      "brocade, sitting and dozing with outstretched legs, with a naked sword\n",
      "on his lap. My fair guide lightly tripped over his legs and held up\n",
      "a fringe of the screen. I could catch a glimpse of a part of the room\n",
      "spread with a Persian carpet--some one was sitting inside on a bed--I\n",
      "could not see her, but only caught a glimpse of two exquisite feet\n",
      "in gold-embroidered slippers, hanging out from loose saffron-coloured\n",
      "paijamas and placed idly on the orange-coloured velvet carpet. On one\n",
      "side there was a bluish crystal tray on which a few apples, pears,\n",
      "oranges, and bunches of grapes in plenty, two small cups and a\n",
      "gold-tinted decanter were evidently waiting the guest. A fragrant\n",
      "intoxicating vapour, issuing from a strange sort of incense that burned\n",
      "within, almost overpowered my senses.\n",
      "\n",
      "As with trembling heart I made an attempt to step across the\n",
      "outstretched legs of the eunuch, he woke up suddenly with a start, and\n",
      "the sword fell from his lap with a sharp clang on the marble floor.\n",
      "A terrific scream made me jump, and I saw I was sitting on that\n",
      "camp-bedstead of mine sweating heavily; and the crescent moon looked\n",
      "pale in the morning light like a weary sleepless patient at dawn; and\n",
      "our crazy Meher Ali was crying out, as is his daily custom, \"Stand back!\n",
      "Stand back!!\" while he went along the lonely road.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such was the abrupt close of one of my Arabian Nights; but there were\n",
      "yet a thousand nights left.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then followed a great discord between my days and nights. During the day\n",
      "I would go to my work worn and tired, cursing the bewitching night and\n",
      "her empty dreams, but as night came my daily life with its bonds and\n",
      "shackles of work would appear a petty, false, ludicrous vanity.\n",
      "\n",
      "After nightfall I was caught and overwhelmed in the snare of a strange\n",
      "intoxication, I would then be transformed into some unknown personage of\n",
      "a bygone age, playing my part in unwritten history; and my short English\n",
      "coat and tight breeches did not suit me in the least. With a red velvet\n",
      "cap on my head, loose paijamas, an embroidered vest, a long flowing silk\n",
      "gown, and coloured handkerchiefs scented with attar, I would complete\n",
      "my elaborate toilet, sit on a high-cushioned chair, and replace my\n",
      "cigarette with a many-coiled narghileh filled with rose-water, as if in\n",
      "eager expectation of a strange meeting with the beloved one.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have no power to describe the marvellous incidents that unfolded\n",
      "themselves, as the gloom of the night deepened. I felt as if in the\n",
      "curious apartments of that vast edifice the fragments of a beautiful\n",
      "story, which I could follow for some distance, but of which I could\n",
      "never see the end, flew about in a sudden gust of the vernal breeze.\n",
      "And all the same I would wander from room to room in pursuit of them the\n",
      "whole night long.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amid the eddy of these dream-fragments, amid the smell of henna and\n",
      "the twanging of the guitar, amid the waves of air charged with fragrant\n",
      "spray, I would catch like a flash of lightning the momentary glimpse of\n",
      "a fair damsel. She it was who had saffron-coloured paijamas, white ruddy\n",
      "soft feet in gold-embroidered slippers with curved toes, a close-fitting\n",
      "bodice wrought with gold, a red cap, from which a golden frill fell on\n",
      "her snowy brow and cheeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had maddened me. In pursuit of her I wandered from room to room,\n",
      "from path to path among the bewildering maze of alleys in the enchanted\n",
      "dreamland of the nether world of sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes in the evening, while arraying myself carefully as a prince of\n",
      "the blood-royal before a large mirror, with a candle burning on either\n",
      "side, I would see a sudden reflection of the Persian beauty by the side\n",
      "of my own. A swift turn of her neck, a quick eager glance of intense\n",
      "passion and pain glowing in her large dark eyes, just a suspicion of\n",
      "speech on her dainty red lips, her figure, fair and slim crowned with\n",
      "youth like a blossoming creeper, quickly uplifted in her graceful\n",
      "tilting gait, a dazzling flash of pain and craving and ecstasy, a smile\n",
      "and a glance and a blaze of jewels and silk, and she melted away. A wild\n",
      "glist of wind, laden with all the fragrance of hills and woods, would\n",
      "put out my light, and I would fling aside my dress and lie down on my\n",
      "bed, my eyes closed and my body thrilling with delight, and there around\n",
      "me in the breeze, amid all the perfume of the woods and hills, floated\n",
      "through the silent gloom many a caress and many a kiss and many a tender\n",
      "touch of hands, and gentle murmurs in my ears, and fragrant breaths on\n",
      "my brow; or a sweetly-perfumed kerchief was wafted again and again on\n",
      "my cheeks. Then slowly a mysterious serpent would twist her stupefying\n",
      "coils about me; and heaving a heavy sigh, I would lapse into\n",
      "insensibility, and then into a profound slumber.\n",
      "\n",
      "One evening I decided to go out on my horse--I do not know who implored\n",
      "me to stay-but I would listen to no entreaties that day. My English hat\n",
      "and coat were resting on a rack, and I was about to take them down when\n",
      "a sudden whirlwind, crested with the sands of the Susta and the dead\n",
      "leaves of the Avalli hills, caught them up, and whirled them round\n",
      "and round, while a loud peal of merry laughter rose higher and higher,\n",
      "striking all the chords of mirth till it died away in the land of\n",
      "sunset.\n",
      "\n",
      "I could not go out for my ride, and the next day I gave up my queer\n",
      "English coat and hat for good.\n",
      "\n",
      "That day again at dead of night I heard the stifled heart-breaking\n",
      "sobs of some one--as if below the bed, below the floor, below the stony\n",
      "foundation of that gigantic palace, from the depths of a dark damp\n",
      "grave, a voice piteously cried and implored me: \"Oh, rescue me! Break\n",
      "through these doors of hard illusion, deathlike slumber and fruitless\n",
      "dreams, place by your side on the saddle, press me to your heart, and,\n",
      "riding through hills and woods and across the river, take me to the warm\n",
      "radiance of your sunny rooms above!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Who am I? Oh, how can I rescue thee? What drowning beauty, what\n",

      "And there, what officer of the Badshah, seeing the glory of thy bashful\n",
      "blossoming youth, paid for thee in gold, placed thee in a golden\n",
      "palanquin, and offered thee as a present for the seraglio of his master?\n",
      "And O, the history of that place! The music of the sareng, the jingle of\n",
      "anklets, the occasional flash of daggers and the glowing wine of Shiraz\n",

      "endless servitude!\n",

      "Stand back!! All is false! All is false!!\" I opened my eyes and saw that\n",
      "it was already light. My chaprasi came and handed me my letters, and the\n",

      "\n",
      "I said; \"No, I can stay here no longer.\" That very day I packed up, and\n",
      "moved to my office. Old Karim Khan smiled a little as he saw me. I felt\n",
      "nettled, but said nothing, and fell to my work.\n",
      "\n",
      "As evening approached I grew absent-minded; I felt as if I had an\n",
      "appointment to keep; and the work of examining the cotton accounts\n",
      "seemed wholly useless; even the Nizamat of the Nizam did not appear to\n",
      "be of much worth. Whatever belonged to the present, whatever was moving\n",
      "and acting and working for bread seemed trivial, meaningless, and\n",
      "contemptible.\n",
      "\n",
      "I threw my pen down, closed my ledgers, got into my dog-cart, and drove\n",
      "away. I noticed that it stopped of itself at the gate of the marble\n",
      "palace just at the hour of twilight. With quick steps I climbed the\n",
      "stairs, and entered the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "A heavy silence was reigning within. The dark rooms were looking sullen\n",
      "as if they had taken offence. My heart was full of contrition, but\n",
      "there was no one to whom I could lay it bare, or of whom I could ask\n",
      "forgiveness. I wandered about the dark rooms with a vacant mind. I\n",
      "wished I had a guitar to which I could sing to the unknown: \"O fire,\n",

      "clouds overcast the top of the Avalli hills that day. The gloomy woods\n",
      "and the sooty waters of the Susta were waiting in terrible suspense and\n",
      "in an ominous calm. Suddenly land, water, and sky shivered, and a wild\n",
      "tempest-blast rushed howling through the distant pathless woods, showing\n",
      "its lightning-teeth like a raving maniac who had broken his chains.\n",
      "The desolate halls of the palace banged their doors, and moaned in the\n",
      "bitterness of anguish.\n",
      "\n",
      "The servants were all in the office, and there was no one to light the\n",
      "lamps. The night was cloudy and moonless. In the dense gloom within I\n",
      "could distinctly feel that a woman was lying on her face on the carpet\n",
      "below the bed--clasping and tearing her long dishevelled hair with\n",
      "desperate fingers. Blood was tricking down her fair brow, and she was\n",
      "now laughing a hard, harsh, mirthless laugh, now bursting into violent\n",
      "wringing sobs, now rending her bodice and striking at her bare bosom,\n",
      "as the wind roared in through the open window, and the rain poured in\n",
      "torrents and soaked her through and through.\n",
      "\n",
      "All night there was no cessation of the storm or of the passionate cry.\n",
      "I wandered from room to room in the dark, with unavailing sorrow. Whom\n",
      "could I console when no one was by? Whose was this intense agony of\n",
      "sorrow? Whence arose this inconsolable grief?\n",
      "\n",
      "And the mad man cried out: \"Stand back! Stand back!! All is false! All\n",

      "I saw that the day had dawned, and Meher Ali was going round and round\n",
      "the palace with his usual cry in that dreadful weather. Suddenly it\n",
      "came to me that perhaps he also had once lived in that house, and that,\n",
      "though he had gone mad, he came there every day, and went round and\n",
      "round, fascinated by the weird spell cast by the marble demon.\n",

      "with his frantic cry, like a bird flying fascinated about the jaws of a\n",
      "snake, and made a desperate effort to warn himself by repeating: \"Stand\n",
      "back! Stand back!! All is false! All is false!!\"\n",

      "unrequited passions and unsatisfied longings and lurid flames of wild\n",
      "blazing pleasure raged within that palace, and that the curse of all\n",
      "the heart-aches and blasted hopes had made its every stone thirsty and\n",
      "hungry, eager to swallow up like a famished ogress any living man who\n",
      "might chance to approach. Not one of those who lived there for three\n",
      "consecutive nights could escape these cruel jaws, save Meher Ali, who\n",
      "had escaped at the cost of his reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "I asked: \"Is there no means whatever of my release?\" The old man said:\n",
      "\"There is only one means, and that is very difficult. I will tell you\n",
      "what it is, but first you must hear the history of a young Persian girl\n",
      "who once lived in that pleasure-dome. A stranger or a more bitterly\n",
      "heart-rending tragedy was never enacted on this earth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Just at this moment the coolies announced that the train was coming.\n",
      "So soon? We hurriedly packed up our luggage, as the tram steamed in. An\n",

      "of a first-class carriage endeavouring to read the name of the station.\n",
      "As soon as he caught sight of our fellow-passenger, he cried, \"Hallo,\"\n",

      "\n",
      "I said; \"The man evidently took us for fools and imposed upon us out of\n",

      "THE VICTORY\n",
      "\n",
      "She was the Princess Ajita. And the court poet of King Narayan had never\n",
      "seen her. On the day he recited a new poem to the king he would raise\n",
      "his voice just to that pitch which could be heard by unseen hearers in\n",
      "the screened balcony high above the hall. He sent up his song towards\n",
      "the star-land out of his reach, where, circled with light, the planet\n",
      "who ruled his destiny shone unknown and out of ken.\n",
      "\n",
      "He would espy some shadow moving behind the veil. A tinkling sound would\n",
      "come to his car from afar, and would set him dreaming of the ankles\n",
      "whose tiny golden bells sang at each step. Ah, the rosy red tender feet\n",
      "that walked the dust of the earth like God's mercy on the fallen! The\n",
      "poet had placed them on the altar of his heart, where he wove his songs\n",
      "to the tune of those golden bells. Doubt never arose in his mind as to\n",
      "whose shadow it was that moved behind the screen, and whose anklets they\n",
      "were that sang to the time of his beating heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Manjari, the maid of the princess, passed by the poet's house on her way\n",
      "to the river, and she never missed a day to have a few words with him on\n",
      "the sly. When she found the road deserted, and the shadow of dusk on\n",
      "the land, she would boldly enter his room, and sit at the corner of\n",
      "his carpet. There was a suspicion of an added care in the choice of the\n",
      "colour of her veil, in the setting of the flower in her hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "People smiled and whispered at this, and they were not to blame. For\n",
      "Shekhar the poet never took the trouble to hide the fact that these\n",
      "meetings were a pure joy to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The meaning of her name was the spray of flowers. One must confess that\n",
      "for an ordinary mortal it was sufficient in its sweetness. But Shekhar\n",
      "made his own addition to this name, and called her the Spray of Spring\n",
      "Flowers. And ordinary mortals shook their heads and said, Ah, me!\n",
      "\n",
      "In the spring songs that the poet sang the praise of the spray of spring\n",
      "flowers was conspicuously reiterated; and the king winked and smiled at\n",
      "him when he heard it, and the poet smiled in answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The king would put him the question; \"Is it the business of the bee\n",
      "merely to hum in the court of the spring?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The poet would answer; \"No, but also to sip the honey of the spray of\n",
      "spring flowers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And they all laughed in the king's hall. And it was rumoured that the\n",
      "Princess Akita also laughed at her maid's accepting the poet's name for\n",
      "her, and Manjari felt glad in her heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus truth and falsehood mingle in life--and to what God builds man adds\n",
      "his own decoration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only those were pure truths which were sung by the poet. The theme was\n",
      "Krishna, the lover god, and Radha, the beloved, the Eternal Man and the\n",
      "Eternal Woman, the sorrow that comes from the beginning of time, and the\n",
      "joy without end. The truth of these songs was tested in his inmost heart\n",
      "by everybody from the beggar to the king himself. The poet's songs were\n",
      "on the lips of all. At the merest glimmer of the moon and the faintest\n",
      "whisper of the summer breeze his songs would break forth in the land\n",
      "from windows and courtyards, from sailing-boats, from shadows of the\n",
      "wayside trees, in numberless voices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus passed the days happily. The poet recited, the king listened, the\n",
      "hearers applauded, Manjari passed and repassed by the poet's room on her\n",
      "way to the river--the shadow flitted behind the screened balcony, and\n",
      "the tiny golden bells tinkled from afar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then set forth from his home in the south a poet on his path of\n",
      "conquest. He came to King Narayan, in the kingdom of Amarapur. He stood\n",
      "before the throne, and uttered a verse in praise of the king. He had\n",
      "challenged all the court poets on his way, and his career of victory had\n",
      "been unbroken.\n",
      "\n",
      "The king received him with honour, and said: \"Poet, I offer you\n",
      "welcome.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pundarik, the poet, proudly replied: \"Sire, I ask for war.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Shekhar, the court poet of the king did not know how the battle of the\n",
      "muse was to be waged. He had no sleep at night. The mighty figure of the\n",
      "famous Pundarik, his sharp nose curved like a scimitar, and his proud\n",
      "head tilted on one side, haunted the poet's vision in the dark.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a trembling heart Shekhar entered the arena in the morning. The\n",
      "theatre was filled with the crowd.\n",
      "\n",
      "The poet greeted his rival with a smile and a bow. Pundarik returned it\n",
      "with a slight toss of his head, and turned his face towards his circle\n",
      "of adoring followers with a meaning smile. Shekhar cast his glance\n",
      "towards the screened balcony high above, and saluted his lady in his\n",
      "mind, saying! \"If I am the winner at the combat to-day, my lady, thy\n",
      "victorious name shall be glorified.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The trumpet sounded. The great crowd stood up, shouting victory to the\n",
      "king. The king, dressed in an ample robe of white, slowly came into the\n",
      "hall like a floating cloud of autumn, and sat on his throne.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pundarik stood up, and the vast hall became still. With his head raised\n",
      "high and chest expanded, he began in his thundering voice to recite the\n",
      "praise of King Narayan. His words burst upon the walls of the hall\n",
      "like breakers of the sea, and seemed to rattle against the ribs of the\n",
      "listening crowd. The skill with which he gave varied meanings to the\n",
      "name Narayan, and wove each letter of it through the web of his verses\n",
      "in all mariner of combinations, took away the breath of his amazed\n",
      "hearers.\n",
      "\n",
      "For some minutes after he took his seat his voice continued to vibrate\n",
      "among the numberless pillars of the king's court and in thousands of\n",
      "speechless hearts. The learned professors who had come from distant\n",
      "lands raised their right hands, and cried, Bravo!\n",
      "\n",
      "The king threw a glance on Shekhar's face, and Shekhar in answer raised\n",
      "for a moment his eyes full of pain towards his master, and then stood\n",
      "up like a stricken deer at bay. His face was pale, his bashfulness was\n",
      "almost that of a woman, his slight youthful figure, delicate in its\n",
      "outline, seemed like a tensely strung vina ready to break out in music\n",
      "at the least touch.\n",
      "\n",
      "His head was bent, his voice was low, when he began. The first few\n",
      "verses were almost inaudible. Then he slowly raised his head, and his\n",
      "clear sweet voice rose into the sky like a quivering flame of fire. He\n",
      "began with the ancient legend of the kingly line lost in the haze of\n",
      "the past, and brought it down through its long course of heroism and\n",
      "matchless generosity to the present age. He fixed his gaze on the king's\n",
      "face, and all the vast and unexpressed love of the people for the royal\n",
      "house rose like incense in his song, and enwreathed the throne on all\n",
      "sides. These were his last words when, trembling, he took his seat: \"My\n",
      "master, I may be beaten in play of words, but not in my love for thee.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tears filled the eyes of the hearers, and the stone walls shook with\n",
      "cries of victory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mocking this popular outburst of feeling, with an august shake of\n",
      "his head and a contemptuous sneer, Pundarik stood up, and flung this\n",
      "question to the assembly; \"What is there superior to words?\" In a moment\n",
      "the hall lapsed into silence again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then with a marvellous display of learning, he proved that the Word was\n",
      "in the beginning, that the Word was God. He piled up quotations from\n",
      "scriptures, and built a high altar for the Word to be seated above all\n",
      "that there is in heaven and in earth. He repeated that question in his\n",
      "mighty voice: \"What is there superior to words?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Proudly he looked around him. None dared to accept his challenge, and\n",
      "he slowly took his seat like a lion who had just made a full meal of\n",
      "its victim. The pandits shouted, Bravo! The king remained silent with\n",
      "wonder, and the poet Shekhar felt himself of no account by the side of\n",
      "this stupendous learning. The assembly broke up for that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next day Shekhar began his song. It was of that day when the pipings of\n",
      "love's flute startled for the first time the hushed air of the Vrinda\n",
      "forest. The shepherd women did not know who was the player or whence\n",
      "came the music. Sometimes it seemed to come from the heart of the south\n",
      "wind, and sometimes from the straying clouds of the hilltops. It came\n",
      "with a message of tryst from the land of the sunrise, and it floated\n",
      "from the verge of sunset with its sigh of sorrow. The stars seemed to\n",
      "be the stops of the instrument that flooded the dreams of the night\n",
      "with melody. The music seemed to burst all at once from all sides,\n",
      "from fields and groves, from the shady lanes and lonely roads, from the\n",
      "melting blue of the sky, from the shimmering green of the grass. They\n",
      "neither knew its meaning nor could they find words to give utterance\n",
      "to the desire of their hearts. Tears filled their eyes, and their life\n",
      "seemed to long for a death that would be its consummation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shekhar forgot his audience, forgot the trial of his strength with a\n",
      "rival. He stood alone amid his thoughts that rustled and quivered round\n",
      "him like leaves in a summer breeze, and sang the Song of the Flute. He\n",
      "had in his mind the vision of an image that had taken its shape from a\n",
      "shadow, and the echo of a faint tinkling sound of a distant footstep.\n",
      "\n",
      "He took his seat. His hearers trembled with the sadness of an\n",
      "indefinable delight, immense and vague, and they forgot to applaud\n",
      "him. As this feeling died away Pundarik stood up before the throne\n",
      "and challenged his rival to define who was this Lover and who was the\n",
      "Beloved. He arrogantly looked around him, he smiled at his followers\n",
      "and then put the question again: \"Who is Krishna, the lover, and who is\n",
      "Radha, the beloved?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he began to analyse the roots of those names,--and various\n",
      "interpretations of their meanings. He brought before the bewildered\n",
      "audience all the intricacies of the different schools of metaphysics\n",
      "with consummate skill. Each letter of those names he divided from its\n",
      "fellow, and then pursued them with a relentless logic till they fell to\n",
      "the dust in confusion, to be caught up again and restored to a meaning\n",
      "never before imagined by the subtlest of word-mongers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pandits were in ecstasy; they applauded vociferously; and the crowd\n",
      "followed them, deluded into the certainty that they had witnessed, that\n",
      "day, the last shred of the curtains of Truth torn to pieces before their\n",
      "eyes by a prodigy of intellect. The performance of his tremendous feat\n",
      "so delighted them that they forgot to ask themselves if there was any\n",
      "truth behind it after all.\n",
      "\n",
      "The king's mind was overwhelmed with wonder. The atmosphere was\n",
      "completely cleared of all illusion of music, and the vision of the world\n",
      "around seemed to be changed from its freshness of tender green to the\n",
      "solidity of a high road levelled and made hard with crushed stones.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the people assembled their own poet appeared a mere boy in comparison\n",
      "with this giant, who walked with such case, knocking down difficulties\n",
      "at each step in the world of words and thoughts. It became evident\n",
      "to them for the first time that the poems Shekhar wrote were absurdly\n",
      "simple, and it must be a mere accident that they did not write them\n",
      "themselves. They were neither new, nor difficult, nor instructive, nor\n",
      "necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "The king tried to goad his poet with keen glances, silently inciting him\n",
      "to make a final effort. But Shekhar took no notice, and remained fixed\n",
      "to his seat.\n",
      "\n",
      "The king in anger came down from his throne--took off his pearl chain\n",
      "and put it on Pundarik's head. Everybody in the hall cheered. From the\n",
      "upper balcony came a slight sound of the movements of rustling robes and\n",
      "waist-chains hung with golden bells. Shekhar rose from his seat and left\n",
      "the hall.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a dark night of waning moon. The poet Shekhar took down his MSS.\n",
      "from his shelves and heaped them on the floor. Some of them contained\n",
      "his earliest writings, which he had almost forgotten. He turned over the\n",
      "pages, reading passages here and there. They all seemed to him poor and\n",
      "trivial--mere words and childish rhymes!\n",
      "\n",
      "One by one he tore his books to fragments, and threw them into a vessel\n",
      "containing fire, and said: \"To thee, to thee, O my beauty, my fire! Thou\n",
      "hast been burning in my heart all these futile years. If my life were\n",
      "a piece of gold it would come out of its trial brighter, but it is a\n",
      "trodden turf of grass, and nothing remains of it but this handful of\n",
      "ashes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The night wore on. Shekhar opened wide his windows. He spread upon\n",
      "his bed the white flowers that he loved, the jasmines, tuberoses and\n",
      "chrysanthemums, and brought into his bedroom all the lamps he had in\n",
      "his house and lighted them. Then mixing with honey the juice of some\n",
      "poisonous root he drank it and lay down on his bed.\n",

      "flooded. The water was knee-deep in our lane. I had a straining hope,\n",
      "which was almost a certainty, that my tutor would be prevented from\n",
      "coming that evening. I sat on the stool in the far corner of the veranda\n",
      "looking down the lane, with a heart beating faster and faster. Every\n",
      "minute I kept my eye on the rain, and when it began to grow less\n",
      "I prayed with all my might; \"Please, God, send some more rain till\n",
      "half-past seven is over.\" For I was quite ready to believe that there\n",
      "was no other need for rain except to protect one helpless boy one\n",
      "evening in one corner of Calcutta from the deadly clutches of his tutor.\n",
      "\n",
      "If not in answer to my prayer, at any rate according to some grosser law\n",
      "of physical nature, the rain did not give up.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, alas! nor did my teacher.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exactly to the minute, in the bend of the lane, I saw his approaching\n",
      "umbrella. The great bubble of hope burst in my breast, and my heart\n",
      "collapsed. Truly, if there is a punishment to fit the crime after death,\n",
      "then my tutor will be born again as me, and I shall be born as my tutor.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as I saw his umbrella I ran as hard as I could to my mother's\n",
      "room. My mother and my grandmother were sitting opposite one another\n",
      "playing cards by the light of a lamp. I ran into the room, and flung\n",
      "myself on the bed beside my mother, and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mother dear, the tutor has come, and I have such a bad headache;\n",
      "couldn't I have no lessons today?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope no child of immature age will be allowed to read this story,\n",
      "and I sincerely trust it will not be used in text-books or primers for\n",
      "schools. For what I did was dreadfully bad, and I received no punishment\n",
      "whatever. On the contrary, my wickedness was crowned with success.\n",
      "\n",
      "My mother said to me: \"All right,\" and turning to the servant added:\n",
      "\"Tell the tutor that he can go back home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was perfectly plain that she didn't think my illness very serious, as\n",
      "she went on with her game as before, and took no further notice. And I\n",
      "also, burying my head in the pillow, laughed to my heart's content. We\n",
      "perfectly understood one another, my mother and I.\n",
      "\n",
      "But every one must know how hard it is for a boy of seven years old to\n",
      "keep up the illusion of illness for a long time. After about a minute I\n",
      "got hold of Grandmother, and said: \"Grannie, do tell me a story.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I had to ask this many times. Grannie and Mother went on playing cards,\n",
      "and took no notice. At last Mother said to me: \"Child, don't bother.\n",
      "Wait till we've finished our game.\" But I persisted: \"Grannie, do tell\n",
      "me a story.\" I told Mother she could finish her game to-morrow, but she\n",
      "must let Grannie tell me a story there and then.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last Mother threw down the cards and said: \"You had better do what\n",
      "he wants. I can't manage him.\" Perhaps she had it in her mind that she\n",
      "would have no tiresome tutor on the morrow, while I should be obliged to\n",
      "be back to those stupid lessons.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as ever Mother had given way, I rushed at Grannie. I got hold\n",
      "of her hand, and, dancing with delight, dragged her inside my mosquito\n",
      "curtain on to the bed. I clutched hold of the bolster with both hands\n",
      "in my excitement, and jumped up and down with joy, and when I had got a\n",
      "little quieter, said: \"Now, Grannie, let' s have the story!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Grannie went on: \"And the king had a queen.\" That was good to begin\n",
      "with. He had only one.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is usual for kings in fairy stories to be extravagant in queens. And\n",
      "whenever we hear that there are two queens, our hearts begin to sink.\n",
      "One is sure to be unhappy. But in Grannie's story that danger was past.\n",
      "He had only one queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "We next hear that the king had not got any son. At the age of seven I\n",
      "didn't think there was any need to bother if a man had had no son. He\n",
      "might only have been in the way. Nor are we greatly excited when we hear\n",
      "that the king has gone away into the forest to practise austerities in\n",
      "order to get a son. There was only one thing that would have made me go\n",
      "into the forest, and that was to get away from my tutor!\n",
      "\n",
      "But the king left behind with his queen a small girl, who grew up into a\n",
      "beautiful princess.\n",
      "\n",
      "Twelve years pass away, and the king goes on practising austerities, and\n",
      "never thinks all this while of his beautiful daughter. The princess has\n",
      "reached the full bloom of her youth. The age of marriage has passed, but\n",
      "the king does not return. And the queen pines away with grief and cries:\n",
      "\"Is my golden daughter destined to die unmarried? Ah me! What a fate is\n",
      "mine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the queen sent men to the king to entreat him earnestly to come\n",
      "back for a single night and take one meal in the palace. And the king\n",
      "consented.\n",
      "\n",
      "The queen cooked with her own hand, and with the greatest care,\n",
      "sixty-four dishes, and made a seat for him of sandal-wood, and arranged\n",
      "the food in plates of gold and cups of silver. The princess stood behind\n",
      "with the peacock-tail fan in her hand. The king, after twelve years'\n",
      "absence, came into the house, and the princess waved the fan, lighting\n",
      "up all the room with her beauty. The king looked in his daughter's face,\n",
      "and forgot to take his food.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last he asked his queen: \"Pray, who is this girl whose beauty shines\n",
      "as the gold image of the goddess? Whose daughter is she?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The queen beat her forehead, and cried: \"Ah, how evil is my fate! Do\n",
      "you not know your own daughter?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The king was struck with amazement. He said at last; \"My tiny daughter\n",
      "has grown to be a woman.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What else?\" the queen said with a sigh. \"Do you not know that twelve\n",
      "years have passed by?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But why did you not give her in marriage?\" asked the king.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You were away,\" the queen said. \"And how could I find her a suitable\n",
      "husband?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The king became vehement with excitement. \"The first man I see\n",
      "to-morrow,\" he said, \"when I come out of the palace shall marry her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The princess went on waving her fan of peacock feathers, and the king\n",
      "finished his meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning, as the king came out of his palace, he saw the son of\n",
      "a Brahman gathering sticks in the forest outside the palace gates. His\n",
      "age was about seven or eight.\n",
      "\n",
      "The king said: \"I will marry my daughter to him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Who can interfere with a king's command? At once the boy was called, and\n",
      "the marriage garlands were exchanged between him and the princess.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point I came up close to my wise Grannie and asked her eagerly:\n",
      "\"What then?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In the bottom of my heart there was a devout wish to substitute myself\n",
      "for that fortunate wood-gatherer of seven years old. The night was\n",
      "resonant with the patter of rain. The earthen lamp by my bedside was\n",
      "burning low. My grandmother's voice droned on as she told the story. And\n",
      "all these things served to create in a corner of my credulous heart the\n",
      "belief that I had been gathering sticks in the dawn of some indefinite\n",
      "time in the kingdom of some unknown king, and in a moment garlands had\n",
      "been exchanged between me and the princess, beautiful as the Goddess of\n",
      "Grace. She had a gold band on her hair and gold earrings in her ears.\n",
      "She bad a necklace and bracelets of gold, and a golden waist-chain round\n",
      "her waist, and a pair of golden anklets tinkled above her feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "If my grandmother were an author how many explanations she would have to\n",
      "offer for this little story! First of all, every one would ask why\n",
      "the king remained twelve years in the forest? Secondly, why should the\n",
      "king's daughter remain unmarried all that while? This would be regarded\n",
      "as absurd.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if she could have got so far without a quarrel, still there would\n",
      "have been a great hue and cry about the marriage itself. First, it never\n",
      "happened. Secondly, how could there be a marriage between a princess of\n",
      "the Warrior Caste and a boy of the priestly Brahman Caste? Her readers\n",
      "would have imagined at once that the writer was preaching against our\n",
      "social customs in an underhand way. And they would write letters to the\n",
      "papers.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I pray with all my heart that my grandmother may be born a\n",
      "grandmother again, and not through some cursed fate take birth as her\n",
      "luckless grandson.\n",
      "\n",
      "So with a throb of joy and delight, I asked Grannie: \"What then?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Grannie went on: Then the princess took her little husband away in\n",
      "great distress, and built a large palace with seven wings, and began to\n",
      "cherish her husband with great care.\n",
      "\n",
      "I jumped up and down in my bed and clutched at the bolster more tightly\n",
      "than ever and said: \"What then?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Grannie continued: The little boy went to school and learnt many lessons\n",
      "from his teachers, and as he grew up his class-fellows began to ask him:\n",
      "\"Who is that beautiful lady who lives with you in the palace with the\n",
      "seven wings?\" The Brahman's son was eager to know who she was. He could\n",
      "only remember how one day he had been gathering sticks, and a great\n",
      "disturbance arose. But all that was so long ago, that he had no clear\n",
      "recollection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Four or five years passed in this way. His companions always asked him:\n",
      "\"Who is that beautiful lady in the palace with the seven wings?\" And the\n",
      "Brahman's son would come back from school and sadly tell the princess:\n",
      "\"My school companions always ask me who is that beautiful lady in the\n",
      "palace with the seven wings, and I can give them no reply. Tell me, oh,\n",
      "tell me, who you are!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The princess said: \"Let it pass to-day. I will tell you some other\n",
      "day.\" And every day the Brahman's son would ask; \"Who are you?\" and the\n",
      "princess would reply: \"Let it pass to-day. I will tell you some other\n",
      "day.\" In this manner four or five more years passed away.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last the Brahman's son became very impatient, and said: \"If you do\n",
      "not tell me to-day who you are, O beautiful lady, I will leave this\n",
      "palace with the seven wings.\" Then the princess said: \"I will certainly\n",
      "tell you to-morrow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Next day the Brahman's son, as soon as he came home from school, said:\n",
      "\"Now, tell me who you are.\" The princess said: \"To-night I will tell you\n",
      "after supper, when you are in bed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Brahman's son said: \"Very well \"; and he began to count the hours\n",
      "in expectation of the night. And the princess, on her side, spread white\n",
      "flowers over the golden bed, and lighted a gold lamp with fragrant oil,\n",
      "and adorned her hair, and dressed herself in a beautiful robe of blue,\n",
      "and began to count the hours in expectation of the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "That evening when her husband, the Brahman's son, had finished his\n",
      "meal, too excited almost to eat, and had gone to the golden bed in the\n",
      "bed-chamber strewn with flowers, he said to himself: \"To-night I shall\n",
      "surely know who this beautiful lady is in the palace with the seven\n",
      "wings.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The princess took for her the food that was left over by her husband,\n",
      "and slowly entered the bed-chamber. She had to answer that night the\n",
      "question, which was the beautiful lady who lived in the palace with\n",
      "the seven wings. And as she went up to the bed to tell him she found a\n",
      "serpent had crept out of the flowers and had bitten the Brahman's son.\n",
      "Her boy-husband was lying on the bed of flowers, with face pale in\n",
      "death.\n",
      "\n",
      "My heart suddenly ceased to throb, and I asked with choking voice: \"What\n",
      "then?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Grannie said; \"Then...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But what is the use of going on any further with the story? It would\n",
      "only lead on to what was more and more impossible. The boy of seven\n",
      "did not know that, if there were some \"What then?\" after death, no\n",
      "grandmother of a grandmother could tell us all about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the child's faith never admits defeat, and it would snatch at the\n",
      "mantle of death itself to turn him back. It would be outrageous for him\n",
      "to think that such a story of one teacherless evening could so suddenly\n",
      "come to a stop. Therefore the grandmother had to call back her story\n",
      "from the ever-shut chamber of the great End, but she does it so simply:\n",
      "it is merely by floating the dead body on a banana stem on the river,\n",
      "and having some incantations read by a magician. But in that rainy night\n",
      "and in the dim light of a lamp death loses all its horror in the mind of\n",
      "the boy, and seems nothing more than a deep slumber of a single night.\n",
      "When the story ends the tired eyelids are weighed down with sleep. Thus\n",
      "it is that we send the little body of the child floating on the back of\n",
      "sleep over the still water of time, and then in the morning read a few\n",
      "verses of incantation to restore him to the world of life and light.\n",

      "THE HOME-COMING\n",
      "\n",
      "Phatik Chakravorti was ringleader among the boys of the village. A new\n",
      "mischief got into his head. There was a heavy log lying on the mud-flat\n",
      "of the river waiting to be shaped into a mast for a boat. He decided\n",
      "that they should all work together to shift the log by main force from\n",
      "its place and roll it away. The owner of the log would be angry and\n",
      "surprised, and they would all enjoy the fun. Every one seconded the\n",
      "proposal, and it was carried unanimously.\n",
      "\n",
      "But just as the fun was about to begin, Makhan, Phatik's younger\n",
      "brother, sauntered up, and sat down on the log in front of them all\n",
      "without a word. The boys were puzzled for a moment. He was pushed,\n",
      "rather timidly, by one of the boys and told to get up but he remained\n",
      "quite unconcerned. He appeared like a young philosopher meditating on\n",
      "the futility of games. Phatik was furious. \"Makhan,\" he cried, \"if you\n",
      "don't get down this minute I'll thrash you!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Makhan only moved to a more comfortable position.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, if Phatik was to keep his regal dignity before the public, it was\n",
      "clear he ought to carry out his threat. But his courage failed him\n",
      "at the crisis. His fertile brain, however, rapidly seized upon a new\n",
      "manoeuvre which would discomfit his brother and afford his followers an\n",
      "added amusement. He gave the word of command to roll the log and Makhan\n",
      "over together. Makhan heard the order, and made it a point of honour\n",
      "to stick on. But he overlooked the fact, like those who attempt earthly\n",
      "fame in other matters, that there was peril in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The boys began to heave at the log with all their might, calling out,\n",
      "\"One, two, three, go,\" At the word \"go\" the log went; and with it went\n",
      "Makhan's philosophy, glory and all.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the other boys shouted themselves hoarse with delight. But Phatik\n",
      "was a little frightened. He knew what was coming. And, sure enough,\n",
      "Makhan rose from Mother Earth blind as Fate and screaming like the\n",
      "Furies. He rushed at Phatik and scratched his face and beat him and\n",
      "kicked him, and then went crying home. The first act of the drama was\n",
      "over.\n",
      "\n",
      "Phatik wiped his face, and sat down on the edge of a sunken barge on the\n",
      "river bank, and began to chew a piece of grass. A boat came up to the\n",
      "landing, and a middle-aged man, with grey hair and dark moustache,\n",
      "stepped on shore. He saw the boy sitting there doing nothing, and asked\n",
      "him where the Chakravortis lived. Phatik went on chewing the grass,\n",
      "and said: \"Over there,\" but it was quite impossible to tell where he\n",
      "pointed. The stranger asked him again. He swung his legs to and fro on\n",
      "the side of the barge, and said; \"Go and find out,\" and continued to\n",
      "chew the grass as before.\n",
      "\n",
      "But now a servant came down from the house, and told Phatik his mother\n",
      "wanted him. Phatik refused to move. But the servant was the master on\n",
      "this occasion. He took Phatik up roughly, and carried him, kicking and\n",
      "struggling in impotent rage.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Phatik came into the house, his mother saw him. She called out\n",
      "angrily: \"So you have been hitting Makhan again?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Phatik answered indignantly: \"No, I haven't; who told you that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "His mother shouted: \"Don't tell lies! You have.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Phatik said suddenly: \"I tell you, I haven't. You ask Makhan!\" But\n",
      "Makhan thought it best to stick to his previous statement. He said:\n",
      "\"Yes, mother. Phatik did hit me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Phatik's patience was already exhausted. He could not hear this\n",
      "injustice. He rushed at Makban, and hammered him with blows: \"Take that\"\n",
      "he cried, \"and that, and that, for telling lies.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "His mother took Makhan's side in a moment, and pulled Phatik away,\n",
      "beating him with her hands. When Phatik pushed her aside, she shouted\n",
      "out: \"What I you little villain! would you hit your own mother?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was just at this critical juncture that the grey-haired stranger\n",
      "arrived. He asked what was the matter. Phatik looked sheepish and\n",
      "ashamed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when his mother stepped back and looked at the stranger, her anger\n",
      "was changed to surprise. For she recognised her brother, and cried:\n",
      "\"Why, Dada! Where have you come from?\" As she said these words, she\n",
      "bowed to the ground and touched his feet. Her brother had gone away soon\n",
      "after she had married, and he had started business in Bombay. His sister\n",
      "had lost her husband while he was In Bombay. Bishamber had now come back\n",
      "to Calcutta, and had at once made enquiries about his sister. He had\n",
      "then hastened to see her as soon as he found out where she was.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next few days were full of rejoicing. The brother asked after the\n",
      "education of the two boys. He was told by his sister that Phatik was a\n",
      "perpetual nuisance. He was lazy, disobedient, and wild. But Makhan was\n",
      "as good as gold, as quiet as a lamb, and very fond of reading, Bishamber\n",
      "kindly offered to take Phatik off his sister's hands, and educate him\n",
      "with his own children in Calcutta. The widowed mother readily agreed.\n",
      "When his uncle asked Phatik If he would like to go to Calcutta with him,\n",
      "his joy knew no bounds, and he said; \"Oh, yes, uncle!\" In a way that\n",
      "made it quite clear that he meant it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was an immense relief to the mother to get rid of Phatik. She had\n",
      "a prejudice against the boy, and no love was lost between the two\n",
      "brothers. She was in daily fear that he would either drown Makhan some\n",
      "day in the river, or break his head in a fight, or run him into some\n",
      "danger or other. At the same time she was somewhat distressed to see\n",
      "Phatik's extreme eagerness to get away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Phatik, as soon as all was settled, kept asking his uncle every minute\n",
      "when they were to start. He was on pins and needles all day long with\n",
      "excitement, and lay awake most of the night. He bequeathed to Makhan,\n",
      "in perpetuity, his fishing-rod, his big kite and his marbles. Indeed, at\n",
      "this time of departure his generosity towards Makhan was unbounded.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they reached Calcutta, Phatik made the acquaintance of his aunt\n",
      "for the first time. She was by no means pleased with this unnecessary\n",
      "addition to her family. She found her own three boys quite enough\n",
      "to manage without taking any one else. And to bring a village lad of\n",
      "fourteen into their midst was terribly upsetting. Bishamber should\n",
      "really have thought twice before committing such an indiscretion.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this world of human affairs there is no worse nuisance than a boy\n",
      "at the age of fourteen. He is neither ornamental, nor useful. It is\n",
      "impossible to shower affection on him as on a little boy; and he is\n",
      "always getting in the way. If he talks with a childish lisp he is called\n",
      "a baby, and if he answers in a grown-up way he is called impertinent.\n",
      "In fact any talk at all from him is resented. Then he is at the\n",
      "unattractive, growing age. He grows out of his clothes with indecent\n",
      "haste; his voice grows hoarse and breaks and quavers; his face grows\n",
      "suddenly angular and unsightly. It is easy to excuse the shortcomings of\n",
      "early childhood, but it is hard to tolerate even unavoidable lapses in a\n",
      "boy of fourteen. The lad himself becomes painfully self-conscious. When\n",
      "he talks with elderly people he is either unduly forward, or else so\n",
      "unduly shy that he appears ashamed of his very existence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet it is at this very age when in his heart of hearts a young lad most\n",
      "craves for recognition and love; and he becomes the devoted slave of any\n",
      "one who shows him consideration. But none dare openly love him, for that\n",
      "would be regarded as undue indulgence, and therefore bad for the boy.\n",
      "So, what with scolding and chiding, he becomes very much like a stray\n",
      "dog that has lost his master.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a boy of fourteen his own home is the only Paradise. To live in a\n",
      "strange house with strange people is little short of torture, while the\n",
      "height of bliss is to receive the kind looks of women, and never to be\n",
      "slighted by them.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was anguish to Phatik to be the unwelcome guest in his aunt's house,\n",
      "despised by this elderly woman, and slighted, on every occasion. If she\n",
      "ever asked him to do anything for her, he would be so overjoyed that he\n",
      "would overdo it; and then she would tell him not to be so stupid, but to\n",
      "get on with his lessons.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cramped atmosphere of neglect in his aunt's house oppressed Phatik\n",
      "so much that he felt that he could hardly breathe. He wanted to go out\n",
      "into the open country and fill his lungs and breathe freely. But there\n",
      "was no open country to go to. Surrounded on all sides by Calcutta houses\n",
      "and walls, he would dream night after night of his village home, and\n",
      "long to be back there. He remembered the glorious meadow where he used\n",
      "to fly his kite all day long; the broad river-banks where he would wander\n",
      "about the livelong day singing and shouting for joy; the narrow brook\n",
      "where he could go and dive and swim at any time he liked. He thought of\n",
      "his band of boy companions over whom he was despot; and, above all, the\n",
      "memory of that tyrant mother of his, who had such a prejudice against\n",
      "him, occupied him day and night. A kind of physical love like that of\n",
      "animals; a longing to be in the presence of the one who is loved; an\n",
      "inexpressible wistfulness during absence; a silent cry of the inmost\n",
      "heart for the mother, like the lowing of a calf in the twilight;-this\n",
      "love, which was almost an animal instinct, agitated the shy, nervous,\n",
      "lean, uncouth and ugly boy. No one could understand it, but it preyed\n",
      "upon his mind continually.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no more backward boy in the whole school than Phatik. He gaped\n",
      "and remained silent when the teacher asked him a question, and like an\n",
      "overladen ass patiently suffered all the blows that came down on his\n",
      "back. When other boys were out at play, he stood wistfully by the window\n",
      "and gazed at the roofs of the distant houses. And if by chance he espied\n",
      "children playing on the open terrace of any roof, his heart would ache\n",
      "with longing.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day he summoned up all his courage, and asked his uncle: \"Uncle,\n",
      "when can I go home?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "His uncle answered; \"Wait till the holidays come.\" But the holidays would\n",
      "not come till November, and there was a long time still to wait.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day Phatik lost his lesson-book. Even with the help of books he\n",
      "had found it very difficult indeed to prepare his lesson. Now it was\n",
      "impossible. Day after day the teacher would cane him unmercifully.\n",
      "His condition became so abjectly miserable that even his cousins were\n",
      "ashamed to own him. They began to jeer and insult him more than the\n",
      "other boys. He went to his aunt at last, and told her that he had lost\n",
      "his book.\n",
      "\n",
      "His aunt pursed her lips in contempt, and said: \"You great clumsy,\n",
      "country lout. How can I afford, with all my family, to buy you new books\n",
      "five times a month?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That night, on his way back from school, Phatik had a bad headache with\n",
      "a fit of shivering. He felt he was going to have an attack of malarial\n",
      "fever. His one great fear was that he would be a nuisance to his aunt.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning Phatik was nowhere to be seen. All searches in the\n",
      "neighbourhood proved futile. The rain had been pouring in torrents all\n",
      "night, and those who went out in search of the boy got drenched through\n",
      "to the skin. At last Bisbamber asked help from the police.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of the day a police van stopped at the door before the house.\n",
      "It was still raining and the streets were all flooded. Two constables\n",
      "brought out Phatik in their arms and placed him before Bishamber. He was\n",
      "wet through from head to foot, muddy all over, his face and eyes flushed\n",
      "red with fever, and his limbs all trembling. Bishamber carried him in\n",
      "his arms, and took him into the inner apartments. When his wife saw him,\n",
      "she exclaimed; \"What a heap of trouble this boy has given us. Hadn't you\n",
      "better send him home?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Phatik heard her words, and sobbed out loud: \"Uncle, I was just going\n",
      "home; but they dragged me back again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The fever rose very high, and all that night the boy was delirious.\n",
      "Bishamber brought in a doctor. Phatik opened his eyes flushed with\n",
      "fever, and looked up to the ceiling, and said vacantly: \"Uncle, have the\n",
      "holidays come yet? May I go home?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bishamber wiped the tears from his own eyes, and took Phatik's lean\n",
      "and burning hands in his own, and sat by him through the night. The boy\n",
      "began again to mutter. At last his voice became excited: \"Mother,\" he\n",
      "cried, \"don't beat me like that! Mother! I am telling the truth!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day Phatik became conscious for a short time. He turned his\n",
      "eyes about the room, as if expecting some one to come. At last, with an\n",
      "air of disappointment, his head sank back on the pillow. He turned his\n",
      "face to the wall with a deep sigh.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bishamber knew his thoughts, and, bending down his head, whispered:\n",
      "\"Phatik, I have sent for your mother.\" The day went by. The doctor said\n",
      "in a troubled voice that the boy's condition was very critical.\n",
      "\n",
      "Phatik began to cry out; \"By the mark!--three fathoms. By the mark--four\n",
      "fathoms. By the mark-.\" He had heard the sailor on the river-steamer\n",
      "calling out the mark on the plumb-line. Now he was himself plumbing an\n",
      "unfathomable sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later in the day Phatik's mother burst into the room like a whirlwind,\n",
      "and began to toss from side to side and moan and cry in a loud voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bishamber tried to calm her agitation, but she flung herself on the bed,\n",
      "and cried: \"Phatik, my darling, my darling.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Phatik stopped his restless movements for a moment. His hands ceased\n",
      "beating up and down. He said: \"Eh?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The mother cried again: \"Phatik, my darling, my darling.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Phatik very slowly turned his head and, without seeing anybody, said:\n",
      "\"Mother, the holidays have come.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "MY LORD, THE BABY\n",
      "\n",
      "I\n",
      "\n",
      "Raicharan was twelve years old when he came as a servant to his master's\n",
      "house. He belonged to the same caste as his master, and was given his\n",
      "master's little son to nurse. As time went on the boy left Raicharan's\n",
      "arms to go to school. From school he went on to college, and after\n",
      "college he entered the judicial service. Always, until he married,\n",
      "Raicharan was his sole attendant.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, when a mistress came into the house, Raicharan found two masters\n",
      "instead of one. All his former influence passed to the new mistress.\n",
      "This was compensated for by a fresh arrival. Anukul had a son born to\n",
      "him, and Raicharan by his unsparing attentions soon got a complete\n",
      "hold over the child. He used to toss him up in his arms, call to him in\n",
      "absurd baby language, put his face close to the baby's and draw it away\n",
      "again with a grin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently the child was able to crawl and cross the doorway. When\n",
      "Raicharan went to catch him, he would scream with mischievous laughter\n",
      "and make for safety. Raicharan was amazed at the profound skill and\n",
      "exact judgment the baby showed when pursued. He would say to his\n",
      "mistress with a look of awe and mystery: \"Your son will be a judge some\n",
      "day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "New wonders came in their turn. When the baby began to toddle, that was\n",
      "to Raicharan an epoch in human history. When he called his father Ba-ba\n",
      "and his mother Ma-ma and Raicharan Chan-na, then Raicharan's ecstasy\n",
      "knew no bounds. He went out to tell the news to all the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a while Raicharan was asked to show his ingenuity in other ways.\n",
      "He had, for instance, to play the part of a horse, holding the reins\n",
      "between his teeth and prancing with his feet. He had also to wrestle\n",
      "with his little charge, and if he could not, by a wrestler's trick, fall\n",
      "on his back defeated at the end, a great outcry was certain.\n",
      "\n",
      "About this time Anukul was transferred to a district on the banks of the\n",
      "Padma. On his way through Calcutta he bought his son a little go-cart.\n",
      "He bought him also a yellow satin waistcoat, a gold-laced cap, and some\n",
      "gold bracelets and anklets. Raicharan was wont to take these out, and\n",
      "put them on his little charge with ceremonial pride, whenever they went\n",
      "for a walk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then came the rainy season, and day after day the rain poured down in\n",
      "torrents. The hungry river, like an enormous serpent, swallowed down\n",
      "terraces, villages, cornfields, and covered with its flood the tall\n",
      "grasses and wild casuarinas on the sand-banks. From time to time there\n",
      "was a deep thud, as the river-banks crumbled. The unceasing roar of\n",
      "the rain current could be beard from far away. Masses of foam, carried\n",
      "swiftly past, proved to the eye the swiftness of the stream.\n",
      "\n",
      "One afternoon the rain cleared. It was cloudy, but cool and bright.\n",
      "Raicharan's little despot did not want to stay in on such a fine\n",
      "afternoon. His lordship climbed into the go-cart. Raicharan, between the\n",
      "shafts, dragged him slowly along till he reached the rice-fields on the\n",
      "banks of the river. There was no one in the fields, and no boat on the\n",
      "stream. Across the water, on the farther side, the clouds were rifted in\n",
      "the west. The silent ceremonial of the setting sun was revealed in all\n",
      "its glowing splendour. In the midst of that stillness the child, all of\n",
      "a sudden, pointed with his finger in front of him and cried: \"Chan-nal\n",
      "Pitty fow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Close by on a mud-flat stood a large Kadamba tree in full flower. My\n",
      "lord, the baby, looked at it with greedy eyes, and Raicharan knew his\n",
      "meaning. Only a short time before he had made, out of these very\n",
      "flower balls, a small go-cart; and the child had been so entirely happy\n",
      "dragging it about with a string, that for the whole day Raicharan was\n",
      "not made to put on the reins at all. He was promoted from a horse into a\n",
      "groom.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Raicharan had no wish that evening to go splashing knee-deep through\n",
      "the mud to reach the flowers. So he quickly pointed his finger in the\n",
      "opposite direction, calling out: \"Oh, look, baby, look! Look at the\n",
      "bird.\" And with all sorts of curious noises he pushed the go-cart\n",
      "rapidly away from the tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "But a child, destined to be a judge, cannot be put off so easily. And\n",
      "besides, there was at the time nothing to attract his eyes. And you\n",
      "cannot keep up for ever the pretence of an imaginary bird.\n",
      "\n",
      "The little Master's mind was made up, and Raicharan was at his wits'\n",
      "end. \"Very well, baby,\" he said at last, \"you sit still in the cart, and\n",
      "I'll go and get you the pretty flower. Only mind you don't go near the\n",
      "water.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As he said this, he made his legs bare to the knee, and waded through\n",
      "the oozing mud towards the tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "The moment Raicharan had gone, his little Master went off at racing\n",
      "speed to the forbidden water. The baby saw the river rushing by,\n",
      "splashing and gurgling as it went. It seemed as though the disobedient\n",
      "wavelets themselves were running away from some greater Raicharan with\n",
      "the laughter of a thousand children. At the sight of their mischief,\n",
      "the heart of the human child grew excited and restless. He got down\n",
      "stealthily from the go-cart and toddled off towards the river. On his\n",
      "way he picked up a small stick, and leant over the bank of the stream\n",
      "pretending to fish. The mischievous fairies of the river with their\n",
      "mysterious voices seemed inviting him into their play-house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Raicharan had plucked a handful of flowers from the tree, and was\n",
      "carrying them back in the end of his cloth, with his face wreathed in\n",
      "smiles. But when he reached the go-cart, there was no one there. He\n",
      "looked on all sides and there was no one there. He looked back at the\n",
      "cart and there was no one there.\n",
      "\n",
      "In that first terrible moment his blood froze within him. Before his\n",
      "eyes the whole universe swam round like a dark mist. From the depth\n",
      "of his broken heart he gave one piercing cry; \"Master, Master, little\n",
      "Master.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But no voice answered \"Chan-na.\" No child laughed mischievously back; no\n",
      "scream of baby delight welcomed his return. Only the river ran on, with\n",
      "its splashing, gurgling noise as before,--as though it knew nothing at\n",
      "all, and had no time to attend to such a tiny human event as the death\n",
      "of a child.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the evening passed by Raicharan's mistress became very anxious. She\n",
      "sent men out on all sides to search. They went with lanterns in their\n",
      "hands, and reached at last the banks of the Padma. There they found\n",
      "Raicharan rushing up and down the fields, like a stormy wind, shouting\n",
      "the cry of despair: \"Master, Master, little Master!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When they got Raicharan home at last, he fell prostrate at his\n",
      "mistress's feet. They shook him, and questioned him, and asked him\n",
      "repeatedly where he had left the child; but all he could say was, that\n",
      "he knew nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though every one held the opinion that the Padma had swallowed the\n",
      "child, there was a lurking doubt left in the mind. For a band of gipsies\n",
      "had been noticed outside the village that afternoon, and some suspicion\n",
      "rested on them. The mother went so far in her wild grief as to think\n",
      "it possible that Raicharan himself had stolen the child. She called him\n",
      "aside with piteous entreaty and said: \"Raicharan, give me back my baby.\n",
      "Oh! give me back my child. Take from me any money you ask, but give me\n",
      "back my child!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Raicharan only beat his forehead in reply. His mistress ordered him out\n",
      "of the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Artukul tried to reason his wife out of this wholly unjust suspicion:\n",
      "\"Why on earth,\" he said, \"should he commit such a crime as that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The mother only replied: \"The baby had gold ornaments on his body. Who\n",
      "knows?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was impossible to reason with her after that.\n",
      "\n",
      "II\n",
      "\n",
      "Raicharan went back to his own village. Up to this time he had had no\n",
      "son, and there was no hope that any child would now be born to him. But\n",
      "it came about before the end of a year that his wife gave birth to a son\n",
      "and died.\n",
      "\n",
      "All overwhelming resentment at first grew up in Raicharan's heart at the\n",
      "sight of this new baby. At the back of his mind was resentful suspicion\n",
      "that it had come as a usurper in place of the little Master. He also\n",
      "thought it would be a grave offence to be happy with a son of his own\n",
      "after what had happened to his master's little child. Indeed, if it had\n",
      "not been for a widowed sister, who mothered the new baby, it would not\n",
      "have lived long.\n",
      "\n",
      "But a change gradually came over Raicharan's mind. A wonderful thing\n",
      "happened. This new baby in turn began to crawl about, and cross the\n",
      "doorway with mischief in its face. It also showed an amusing cleverness\n",
      "in making its escape to safety. Its voice, its sounds of laughter and\n",
      "tears, its gestures, were those of the little Master. On some days,\n",
      "when Raicharan listened to its crying, his heart suddenly began thumping\n",
      "wildly against his ribs, and it seemed to him that his former little\n",
      "Master was crying somewhere in the unknown land of death because he had\n",
      "lost his Chan-na.\n",
      "\n",
      "Phailna (for that was the name Raicharan's sister gave to the new baby)\n",
      "soon began to talk. It learnt to say Ba-ba and Ma-ma with a baby accent.\n",
      "When Raicharan heard those familiar sounds the mystery suddenly became\n",
      "clear. The little Master could not cast off the spell of his Chan-na,\n",
      "and therefore he had been reborn in his own house.\n",
      "\n",
      "The arguments in favour of this were, to Raicharan, altogether beyond\n",
      "dispute:\n",
      "\n",
      "(i.) The new baby was born soon after his little master's death.\n",
      "\n",
      "(ii.) His wife could never have accumulated such merit as to give birth\n",
      "to a son in middle age.\n",
      "\n",
      "(iii.) The new baby walked with a toddle and called out Ba-ba and Ma-ma.\n",
      "There was no sign lacking which marked out the future judge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then suddenly Raicharan remembered that terrible accusation of the\n",
      "mother. \"Ah,\" he said to himself with amazement, \"the mother's heart was\n",
      "right. She knew I had stolen her child.\" When once he had come to this\n",
      "conclusion, he was filled with remorse for his past neglect. He now gave\n",
      "himself over, body and soul, to the new baby, and became its devoted\n",
      "attendant. He began to bring it up, as if it were the son of a rich man.\n",
      "He bought a go-cart, a yellow satin waistcoat, and a gold-embroidered\n",
      "cap. He melted down the ornaments of his dead wife, and made gold\n",
      "bangles and anklets. He refused to let the little child play with any\n",
      "one of the neighbourhood, and became himself its sole companion day and\n",
      "night. As the baby grew up to boyhood, he was so petted and spoilt\n",
      "and clad in such finery that the village children would call him \"Your\n",
      "Lordship,\" and jeer at him; and older people regarded Raicharan as\n",
      "unaccountably crazy about the child.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last the time came for the boy to go to school. Raicharan sold his\n",
      "small piece of land, and went to Calcutta. There he got employment with\n",
      "great difficulty as a servant, and sent Phailna to school. He spared no\n",
      "pains to give him the best education, the best clothes, the best food.\n",
      "Meanwhile he lived himself on a mere handful of rice, and would say in\n",
      "secret: \"Ah! my little Master, my dear little Master, you loved me so\n",
      "much that you came back to my house. You shall never suffer from any\n",
      "neglect of mine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Twelve years passed away in this manner. The boy was able to read and\n",
      "write well. He was bright and healthy and good-looking. He paid a great\n",
      "deal of attention to his personal appearance, and was specially careful\n",
      "in parting his hair. He was inclined to extravagance and finery, and\n",
      "spent money freely. He could never quite look on Raicharan as a father,\n",
      "because, though fatherly in affection, he had the manner of a servant.\n",
      "A further fault was this, that Raicharan kept secret from every one that\n",
      "himself was the father of the child.\n",
      "\n",
      "The students of the hostel, where Phailna was a boarder, were greatly\n",
      "amused by Raicharan's country manners, and I have to confess that behind\n",
      "his father's back Phailna joined in their fun. But, in the bottom of\n",
      "their hearts, all the students loved the innocent and tender-hearted old\n",
      "man, and Phailna was very fond of him also. But, as I have said before,\n",
      "he loved him with a kind of condescension.\n",
      "\n",
      "Raicharan grew older and older, and his employer was continually finding\n",
      "fault with him for his incompetent work. He had been starving himself\n",
      "for the boy's sake. So he had grown physically weak, and no longer up to\n",
      "his work. He would forget things, and his mind became dull and stupid.\n",
      "But his employer expected a full servant's work out of him, and would\n",
      "not brook excuses. The money that Raicharan had brought with him from\n",
      "the sale of his land was exhausted. The boy was continually grumbling\n",
      "about his clothes, and asking for more money.\n",
      "\n",
      "Raicharan made up his mind. He gave up the situation where he was\n",
      "working as a servant, and left some money with Phailna and said: \"I have\n",
      "some business to do at home in my village, and shall be back soon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He went off at once to Baraset where Anukul was magistrate. Anukul's\n",
      "wife was still broken down with grief. She had had no other child.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day Anukul was resting after a long and weary day in court. His wife\n",
      "was buying, at an exorbitant price, a herb from a mendicant quack, which\n",
      "was said to ensure the birth of a child. A voice of greeting was\n",
      "heard in the courtyard. Anukul went out to see who was there. It was\n",
      "Raicharan. Anukul's heart was softened when he saw his old servant. He\n",
      "asked him many questions, and offered to take him back into service.\n",
      "\n",
      "Raicharan smiled faintly, and said in reply; \"I want to make obeisance\n",
      "to my mistress.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anukul went with Raicharan into the house, where the mistress did not\n",
      "receive him as warmly as his old master. Raicharan took no notice of\n",
      "this, but folded his hands, and said: \"It was not the Padma that stole\n",
      "your baby. It was I.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anukul exclaimed: \"Great God! Eh! What! Where is he?\" Raicharan replied:\n",
      "\"He is with me, I will bring him the day after to-morrow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was Sunday. There was no magistrate's court sitting. Both husband and\n",
      "wife were looking expectantly along the road, waiting from early morning\n",
      "for Raicharan's appearance. At ten o'clock he came, leading Phailna by\n",
      "the hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anukul's wife, without a question, took the boy into her lap, and was\n",
      "wild with excitement, sometimes laughing, sometimes weeping, touching\n",
      "him, kissing his hair and his forehead, and gazing into his face with\n",
      "hungry, eager eyes. The boy was very good-looking and dressed like a\n",
      "gentleman's son. The heart of Anukul brimmed over with a sudden rush of\n",
      "affection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless the magistrate in him asked: \"Have you any proofs?\"\n",
      "Raicharan said: \"How could there be any proof of such a deed? God alone\n",
      "knows that I stole your boy, and no one else in the world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When Anukul saw how eagerly his wife was clinging to the boy, he\n",
      "realised the futility of asking for proofs. It would be wiser to\n",
      "believe. And then--where could an old man like Raicharan get such a boy\n",
      "from? And why should his faithful servant deceive him for nothing?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But,\" he added severely, \"Raicharan, you must not stay here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where shall I go, Master?\" said Raicharan, in a choking voice, folding\n",
      "his hands; \"I am old. Who will take in an old man as a servant?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The mistress said: \"Let him stay. My child will be pleased. I forgive\n",
      "him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Anukul's magisterial conscience would not allow him. \"No,\" he said,\n",
      "\"he cannot be forgiven for what he has done.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Raicharan bowed to the ground, and clasped Anukul's feet. \"Master,\" he\n",
      "cried, \"let me stay. It was not I who did it. It was God.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anukul's conscience was worse stricken than ever, when Raicharan tried\n",
      "to put the blame on God's shoulders.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" he said, \"I could not allow it. I cannot trust you any more. You\n",
      "have done an act of treachery.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Raicharan rose to his feet and said: \"It was not I who did it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who was it then?\" asked Anukul.\n",
      "\n",
      "Raicharan replied: \"It was my fate.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But no educated man could take this for an excuse. Anukul remained\n",
      "obdurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Phailna saw that he was the wealthy magistrate's son, and not\n",
      "Raicharan's, he was angry at first, thinking that he had been cheated\n",
      "all this time of his birthright. But seeing Raicharan in distress, he\n",
      "generously said to his father: \"Father, forgive him. Even if you don't\n",
      "let him live with us, let him have a small monthly pension.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After hearing this, Raicharan did not utter another word. He looked\n",
      "for the last time on the face of his son; he made obeisance to his\n",
      "old master and mistress. Then he went out, and was mingled with the\n",
      "numberless people of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of the month Anukul sent him some money to his village. But\n",
      "the money came back. There was no one there of the name of Raicharan.\n",

      "THE KINGDOM OF CARDS\n",
      "\n",
      "I\n",
      "\n",
      "Once upon a time there was a lonely island in a distant sea where lived\n",
      "the Kings and Queens, the Aces and the Knaves, in the Kingdom of Cards.\n",
      "The Tens and Nines, with the Twos and Threes, and all the other members,\n",
      "had long ago settled there also. But these were not twice-born people,\n",
      "like the famous Court Cards.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ace, the King, and the Knave were the three highest castes. The\n",
      "fourth Caste was made up of a mixture of the lower Cards. The Twos and\n",
      "Threes were lowest of all. These inferior Cards were never allowed to\n",
      "sit in the same row with the great Court Cards.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wonderful indeed were the regulations and rules of that island kingdom.\n",
      "The particular rank of each individual had been settled from time\n",
      "immemorial. Every one had his own appointed work, and never did anything\n",
      "else. An unseen hand appeared to be directing them wherever they\n",
      "went,--according to the Rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one in the Kingdom of Cards had any occasion to think: no one had any\n",
      "need to come to any decision: no one was ever required to debate any\n",
      "new subject. The citizens all moved along in a listless groove without\n",
      "speech. When they fell, they made no noise. They lay down on their\n",
      "backs, and gazed upward at the sky with each prim feature firmly fixed\n",
      "for ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a remarkable stillness in the Kingdom of Cards. Satisfaction\n",
      "and contentment were complete in all their rounded wholeness. There\n",
      "was never any uproar or violence. There was never any excitement or\n",
      "enthusiasm.\n",
      "\n",
      "The great ocean, crooning its lullaby with one unceasing melody, lapped\n",
      "the island to sleep with a thousand soft touches of its wave's white\n",
      "hands. The vast sky, like the outspread azure wings of the brooding\n",
      "mother-bird, nestled the island round with its downy plume. For on the\n",
      "distant horizon a deep blue line betokened another shore. But no sound\n",
      "of quarrel or strife could reach the Island of Cards, to break its calm\n",
      "repose.\n",
      "\n",
      "II\n",
      "\n",
      "In that far-off foreign land across the sea, there lived a young Prince\n",
      "whose mother was a sorrowing queen. This queen had fallen from favour,\n",
      "and was living with her only son on the seashore. The Prince passed his\n",
      "childhood alone and forlorn, sitting by his forlorn mother, weaving the\n",
      "net of his big desires. He longed to go in search of the Flying Horse,\n",
      "the Jewel in the Cobra's hood, the Rose of Heaven, the Magic Roads, or\n",
      "to find where the Princess Beauty was sleeping in the Ogre's castle over\n",
      "the thirteen rivers and across the seven seas.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the Son of the Merchant at school the young Prince learnt the\n",
      "stories of foreign kingdoms. From the Son of the Kotwal he learnt the\n",
      "adventures of the Two Genii of the Lamp. And when the rain came beating\n",
      "down, and the clouds covered the sky, he would sit on the threshold\n",
      "facing the sea, and say to his sorrowing mother: \"Tell me, mother, a\n",
      "story of some very far-off land.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And his mother would tell him an endless tale she had heard in her\n",
      "childhood of a wonderful country beyond the sea where dwelt the Princess\n",
      "Beauty. And the heart of the young Prince would become sick with\n",
      "longing, as he sat on the threshold, looking out on the ocean, listening\n",
      "to his mother's wonderful story, while the rain outside came beating\n",
      "down and the grey clouds covered the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day the Son of the Merchant came to the Prince, and said boldly:\n",
      "\"Comrade, my studies are over. I am now setting out on my travels to\n",
      "seek my fortunes on the sea. I have come to bid you good-bye.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Prince said; \"I will go with you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And the Son of Kotwal said also: \"Comrades, trusty and true, you will\n",
      "not leave me behind. I also will be your companion.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the young Prince said to his sorrowing mother; \"Mother, I am now\n",
      "setting out on my travels to seek my fortune. When I come back once\n",
      "more, I shall surely have found some way to remove all your sorrow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So the Three Companions set out on their travels together. In the\n",
      "harbour were anchored the twelve ships of the merchant, and the Three\n",
      "Companions got on board. The south wind was blowing, and the twelve\n",
      "ships sailed away, as fast as the desires which rose in the Prince's\n",
      "breast.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the Conch Shell Island they filled one ship with conchs. At the\n",
      "Sandal Wood Island they filled a second ship with sandal-wood, and at\n",
      "the Coral Island they filled a third ship with coral.\n",
      "\n",
      "Four years passed away, and they filled four more ships, one with ivory,\n",
      "one with musk, one with cloves, and one with nutmegs.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when these ships were all loaded a terrible tempest arose. The ships\n",
      "were all of them sunk, with their cloves and nutmeg, and musk and\n",
      "ivory, and coral and sandal-wood and conchs. But the ship with the Three\n",
      "Companions struck on an island reef, buried them safe ashore, and itself\n",
      "broke in pieces.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the famous Island of Cards, where lived the Ace and King\n",
      "and Queen and Knave, with the Nines and Tens and all the other\n",
      "Members--according to the Rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "III\n",
      "\n",
      "Up till now there had been nothing to disturb that island stillness. No\n",
      "new thing had ever happened. No discussion had ever been held.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then, of a sudden, the Three Companions appeared, thrown up by\n",
      "the sea,--and the Great Debate began. There were three main points of\n",
      "dispute.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, to what caste should these unclassed strangers belong? Should\n",
      "they rank with the Court Cards? Or were they merely lower-caste people,\n",
      "to be ranked with the Nines and Tens? No precedent could be quoted to\n",
      "decide this weighty question.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, what was their clan? Had they the fairer hue and bright\n",
      "complexion of the Hearts, or was theirs the darker complexion of the\n",
      "Clubs? Over this question there were interminable disputes. The whole\n",
      "marriage system of the island, with its intricate regulations, would\n",
      "depend on its nice adjustment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thirdly, what food should they take? With whom should they live and\n",
      "sleep? And should their heads be placed south-west, north-west, or only\n",
      "north-east? In all the Kingdom of Cards a series of problems so vital\n",
      "and critical had never been debated before.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Three Companions grew desperately hungry. They had to get\n",
      "food in some way or other. So while this debate went on, with its\n",
      "interminable silence and pauses, and while the Aces called their own\n",
      "meeting, and formed themselves into a Committee, to find some obsolete\n",
      "dealing with the question, the Three Companions themselves were eating\n",
      "all they could find, and drinking out of every vessel, and breaking all\n",
      "regulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even the Twos and Threes were shocked at this outrageous behaviour. The\n",
      "Threes said; \"Brother Twos, these people are openly shameless!\" And\n",
      "the Twos said: \"Brother Threes, they are evidently of lower caste than\n",
      "ourselves!\" After their meal was over, the Three Companions went for a\n",
      "stroll in the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they saw the ponderous people moving in their dismal processions\n",
      "with prim and solemn faces, then the Prince turned to the Son of the\n",
      "Merchant and the Son of the Kotwal, and threw back his head, and gave\n",
      "one stupendous laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "Down Royal Street and across Ace Square and along the Knave Embankment\n",
      "ran the quiver of this strange, unheard-of laughter, the laughter that,\n",
      "amazed at itself, expired in the vast vacuum of silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Son of the Kotwal and the Son of the Merchant were chilled through\n",
      "to the bone by the ghost-like stillness around them. They turned to the\n",
      "Prince, and said: \"Comrade, let us away. Let us not stop for a moment in\n",
      "this awful land of ghosts.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Prince said: \"Comrades, these people resemble men, so I am going\n",
      "to find out, by shaking them upside down and outside in, whether they\n",
      "have a single drop of warm living blood left in their veins.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "IV\n",
      "\n",
      "The days passed one by one, and the placid existence of the Island went\n",
      "on almost without a ripple. The Three Companions obeyed no rules nor\n",
      "regulations. They never did anything correctly either in sitting or\n",
      "standing or turning themselves round or lying on their back. On the\n",
      "contrary, wherever they saw these things going on precisely and exactly\n",
      "according to the Rules, they gave way to inordinate laughter. They\n",
      "remained unimpressed altogether by the eternal gravity of those eternal\n",
      "regulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day the great Court Cards came to the Son of the Kotwal and the Son\n",
      "of the Merchant and the Prince.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why,\" they asked slowly, \"are you not moving according to the Rules?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Three Companions answered: \"Because that is our Ichcha (wish).\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The great Court Cards with hollow, cavernous voices, as if slowly\n",
      "awakening from an age-long dream, said together: \"Ich-cha! And pray who\n",
      "is Ich-cha?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They could not understand who Ichcha was then, but the whole island\n",
      "was to understand it by-and-by. The first glimmer of light passed the\n",
      "threshold of their minds when they found out, through watching the\n",
      "actions of the Prince, that they might move in a straight line in an\n",
      "opposite direction from the one in which they had always gone before.\n",
      "Then they made another startling discovery, that there was another side\n",
      "to the Cards which they had never yet noticed with attention. This was\n",
      "the beginning of the change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that the change had begun, the Three Companions were able to\n",
      "initiate them more and more deeply into the mysteries of Ichcha. The\n",
      "Cards gradually became aware that life was not bound by regulations.\n",
      "They began to feel a secret satisfaction in the kingly power of choosing\n",
      "for themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "But with this first impact of Ichcha the whole pack of cards began to\n",
      "totter slowly, and then tumble down to the ground. The scene was like\n",
      "that of some huge python awaking from a long sleep, as it slowly unfolds\n",
      "its numberless coils with a quiver that runs through its whole frame.\n",
      "\n",
      "V\n",
      "\n",
      "Hitherto the Queens of Spades and Clubs and Diamonds and Hearts had\n",
      "remained behind curtains with eyes that gazed vacantly into space, or\n",
      "else remained fixed upon the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now, all of a sudden, on an afternoon in spring the Queen of Hearts\n",
      "from the balcony raised her dark eyebrows for a moment, and cast a\n",
      "single glance upon the Prince from the corner of her eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Great God,\" cried the Prince, \"I thought they were all painted images.\n",
      "But I am wrong. They are women after all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the young Prince called to his side his two Companions, and said\n",
      "in a meditative voice; \"My comrades! There is a charm about these ladies\n",
      "that I never noticed before. When I saw that glance of the Queen's dark,\n",
      "luminous eyes, brightening with new emotion, it seemed to me like the\n",
      "first faint streak of dawn in a newly created world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The two Companions smiled a knowing smile, and said: \"Is that really so,\n",
      "Prince?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And the poor Queen of Hearts from that day went from bad to worse.\n",
      "She began to forget all rules in a truly scandalous manner. If, for\n",
      "instance, her place in the row was beside the Knave, she suddenly found\n",
      "herself quite accidentally standing beside the Prince instead. At this,\n",
      "the Knave, with motionless face and solemn voice, would say: \"Queen, you\n",
      "have made a mistake.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And the poor Queen of Hearts' red cheeks would get redder than ever. But\n",
      "the Prince would come gallantly to her rescue and say: \"No! There is no\n",
      "mistake. From to-day I am going to be Knave!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now it came to pass that, while every one was trying to correct the\n",
      "improprieties of the guilty Queen of Hearts, they began to make mistakes\n",
      "themselves. The Aces found themselves elbowed out by the Kings. The\n",
      "Kings got muddled up with the Knaves. The Nines and Tens assumed airs as\n",
      "though they belonged to the Great Court Cards. The Twos and Threes were\n",
      "found secretly taking the places specially resented for the Fours and\n",
      "Fives. Confusion had never been so confounded before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many spring seasons had come and gone in that Island of Cards. The\n",
      "Kokil, the bird of Spring, had sung its song year after year. But it had\n",
      "never stirred the blood as it stirred it now. In days gone by the sea\n",
      "had sung its tireless melody. But, then, it had proclaimed only the\n",
      "inflexible monotony of the Rule. And suddenly its waves were telling,\n",
      "through all their flashing light and luminous shade and myriad voices,\n",
      "the deepest yearnings of the heart of love!\n",
      "\n",
      "VI\n",
      "\n",
      "Where are vanished now their prim, round, regular, complacent features?\n",
      "Here is a face full of love-sick longing. Here is a heart heating wild\n",
      "with regrets. Here is a mind racked sore with doubts. Music and sighing,\n",
      "and smiles and tears, are filling the air. Life is throbbing; hearts are\n",
      "breaking; passions are kindling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every one is now thinking of his own appearance, and comparing himself\n",
      "with others. The Ace of Clubs is musing to himself, that the King of\n",
      "Spades may be just passably good-looking. \"But,\" says he, \"when I walk\n",
      "down the street you have only to see how people's eyes turn towards me.\"\n",
      "The King of Spades is saying; \"Why on earth is that Ace of Clubs always\n",
      "straining his neck and strutting about like a peacock? He imagines all\n",
      "the Queens are dying of love for him, while the real fact is--\" Here he\n",
      "pauses, and examines his face in the glass.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Queens were the worst of all. They began to spend all their time\n",
      "in dressing themselves up to the Nines. And the Nines would become their\n",
      "hopeless and abject slaves. But their cutting remarks about one another\n",
      "were more shocking still.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the young men would sit listless on the leaves under the trees,\n",
      "lolling with outstretched limbs in the forest shade. And the young\n",
      "maidens, dressed in pale-blue robes, would come walking accidentally to\n",
      "the same shade of the same forest by the same trees, and turn their eyes\n",
      "as though they saw no one there, and look as though they came out to see\n",
      "nothing at all. And then one young man more forward than the rest in\n",
      "a fit of madness would dare to go near to a maiden in blue. But, as he\n",
      "drew near, speech would forsake him. He would stand there tongue-tied\n",
      "and foolish, and the favourable moment would pass.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Kokil birds were singing in the boughs overhead. The mischievous\n",
      "South wind was blowing; it disarrayed the hair, it whispered in the\n",
      "ear, and stirred the music in the blood. The leaves of the trees were\n",
      "murmuring with rustling delight. And the ceaseless sound of the ocean\n",
      "made all the mute longings of the heart of man and maid surge backwards\n",
      "and forwards on the full springtide of love.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Three Companions had brought into the dried-up channels of the\n",
      "Kingdom of Cards the full flood-tide of a new life.\n",
      "\n",
      "VII\n",
      "\n",
      "And, though the tide was full, there-was a pause as though the rising\n",
      "waters would not break into foam but remain suspended for ever. There\n",
      "were no outspoken words, only a cautious going forward one step and\n",
      "receding two. All seemed busy heaping up their unfulfilled desires\n",
      "like castles in the air, or fortresses of sand. They were pale and\n",
      "speechless, their eyes were burning, their lips trembling with unspoken\n",
      "secrets.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Prince saw what was wrong. He summoned every one on the Island and\n",
      "said: \"Bring hither the flutes and the cymbals, the pipes and drums.\n",
      "Let all be played together, and raise loud shouts of rejoicing. For the\n",
      "Queen of Hearts this very night is going to choose her Mate!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So the Tens and Nines began to blow on their flutes and pipes; the\n",
      "Eights and Sevens played on their sackbuts and viols; and even the Twos\n",
      "and Threes began to beat madly on their drums.\n",
      "\n",
      "When this tumultous gust of music came, it swept away at one blast all\n",
      "those sighings and mopings. And then what a torrent of laughter and\n",
      "words poured forth! There were daring proposals and locking refusals,\n",
      "and gossip and chatter, and jests and merriment. It was like the swaying\n",
      "and shaking, and rustling and soughing, in a summer gale, of a million\n",
      "leaves and branches in the depth of the primeval forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Queen of Hearts, in a rose-red robe, sat silent in the shadow\n",
      "of her secret bower, and listened to the great uproarious sound of music\n",
      "and mirth, that came floating towards her. She shut her eyes, and dreamt\n",
      "her dream of lore. And when she opened them she found the Prince seated\n",
      "on the ground before her gazing up at her face. And she covered her eyes\n",
      "with both hands, and shrank back quivering with an inward tumult of joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the Prince passed the whole day alone, walking by the side of the\n",
      "surging sea. He carried in his mind that startled look, that shrinking\n",
      "gesture of the Queen, and his heart beat high with hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "That night the serried, gaily-dressed ranks of young men and maidens\n",
      "waited with smiling faces at the Palace Gates. The Palace Hall was\n",
      "lighted with fairy lamps and festooned with the flowers of spring.\n",
      "Slowly the Queen of Hearts entered, and the whole assembly rose to greet\n",
      "her. With a jasmine garland in her hand, she stood before the Prince\n",
      "with downcast eyes. In her lowly bashfulness she could hardly raise the\n",
      "garland to the neck of the Mate she had chosen. But the Prince bowed his\n",
      "head, and the garland slipped to its place. The assembly of youths and\n",
      "maidens had waited her choice with eager, expectant hush. And when\n",
      "the choice was made, the whole vast concourse rocked and swayed with a\n",
      "tumult of wild delight. And the sound of their shouts was heard in every\n",
      "part of the island, and by ships far out at sea. Never had such a shout\n",
      "been raised in the Kingdom of Cards before.\n",
      "\n",
      "And they carried the Prince and his Bride, and seated them on the\n",
      "throne, and crowned them then and there in the Ancient Island of Cards.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the sorrowing Mother Queen, on the 'far-off island shore on the\n",
      "other side of the sea, came sailing to her son's new kingdom in a ship\n",
      "adorned with gold.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the citizens are no longer regulated according to the Rules, but are\n",
      "good or bad, or both, according to their Ichcha.\n",

      "THE DEVOTEE\n",
      "\n",
      "At a time, when my unpopularity with a part of my readers had reached\n",
      "the nadir of its glory, and my name had become the central orb of the\n",
      "journals, to be attended through space with a perpetual rotation of\n",
      "revilement, I felt the necessity to retire to some quiet place and\n",
      "endeavour to forget my own existence.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have a house in the country some miles away from Calcutta, where I\n",
      "can remain unknown and unmolested. The villagers there have not, as yet,\n",
      "come to any conclusion about me. They know I am no mere holiday-maker or\n",
      "pleasure-seeker; for I never outrage the silence of the village nights\n",
      "with the riotous noises of the city. Nor do they regard me as ascetic,\n",
      "because the little acquaintance they have of me carries the savour of\n",
      "comfort about it. I am not, to them, a traveller; for, though I am a\n",
      "vagabond by nature, my wandering through the village fields is aimless.\n",
      "They are hardly even quite certain whether I am married or single; for\n",
      "they have never seen me with my children. So, not being able to classify\n",
      "me in any animal or vegetable kingdom that they know, they have long\n",
      "since given me up and left me stolidly alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "But quite lately I have come to know that there is one person in the\n",
      "village who is deeply interested in me. Our acquaintance began on a\n",
      "sultry afternoon in July. There had been rain all the morning, and the\n",
      "air was still wet and heavy with mist, like eyelids when weeping is\n",
      "over.\n",
      "\n",
      "I sat lazily watching a dappled cow grazing on the high bank of the\n",
      "river. The afternoon sun was playing on her glossy hide. The simple\n",
      "beauty of this dress of light made me wonder idly at man's deliberate\n",
      "waste of money in setting up tailors' shops to deprive his own skin of\n",
      "its natural clothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "While I was thus watching and lazily musing, a woman of middle age came\n",
      "and prostrated herself before me, touching the ground with her forehead.\n",
      "She carried in her robe some bunches of flowers, one of which she\n",
      "offered to me with folded hands. She said to me, as she offered it:\n",
      "\"This is an offering to my God.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She went away. I was so taken aback as she uttered these words, that\n",
      "I could hardly catch a glimpse of her before she was gone. The whole\n",
      "incident was entirely simple, but it left a deep impression on my mind;\n",
      "and as I turned back once more to look at the cattle in the field,\n",
      "the zest of life in the cow, who was munching the lush grass with deep\n",
      "breaths, while she whisked off the flies, appeared to me fraught with\n",
      "mystery. My readers may laugh at my foolishness, but my heart was full\n",
      "of adoration. I offered my worship to the pure joy of living, which is\n",
      "God's own life. Then, plucking a tender shoot from the mango tree, I\n",
      "fed the cow with it from my own hand, and as I did this I had the\n",
      "satisfaction of having pleased my God.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next year when I returned to the village it was February. The cold\n",
      "season still lingered on. The morning sun came into my room, and I was\n",
      "grateful for its warmth. I was writing, when the servant came to tell me\n",
      "that a devotee, of the Vishnu cult, wanted to see me. I told him, in\n",
      "an absent way, to bring her upstairs, and went on with my writing. The\n",
      "Devotee came in, and bowed to me, touching my feet. I found that she was\n",
      "the same woman whom I had met, for a brief moment, a year ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was able now to examine her more closely. She was past that age when\n",
      "one asks the question whether a woman is beautiful or not. Her stature\n",
      "was above the ordinary height, and she was strongly built; but her body\n",
      "was slightly bent owing to her constant attitude of veneration. Her\n",
      "manner had nothing shrinking about it. The most remarkable of her\n",
      "features were her two eyes. They seemed to have a penetrating power\n",
      "which could make distance near.\n",
      "\n",
      "With those two large eyes of hers, she seemed to push me as she entered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is this?\" she asked. \"Why have you brought me here before your\n",
      "throne, my God? I used to see you among the trees; and that was much\n",
      "better. That was the true place to meet you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She must have seen me walking in the garden without my seeing her. For\n",
      "the last few clays, however, I had suffered from a cold, and had been\n",
      "prevented from going out. I had, perforce, to stay indoors and pay my\n",
      "homage to the evening sky from my terrace. After a silent pause the\n",
      "Devotee said to me: \"O my God, give me some words of good.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I was quite unprepared for this abrupt request, and answered her on the\n",
      "spur of the moment: \"Good words I neither give nor receive. I simply\n",
      "open my eyes and keep silence, and then I can at once both hear and see,\n",
      "even when no sound is uttered. Now, while I am looking at you, it is as\n",
      "good as listening to your voice.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Devotee became quite excited as I spoke, and exclaimed: \"God speaks\n",
      "to me, not only with His mouth, but with His whole body.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I said to her: \"When I am silent I can listen with my whole body. I have\n",
      "come away from Calcutta here to listen to that sound.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Devotee said: \"Yes, I know that, and therefore I have come here to\n",
      "sit by you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Before taking her leave, she again bowed to me, and touched my feet.\n",
      "I could see that she was distressed, because my feet were covered. She\n",
      "wished them to be bare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Early next morning I came out, and sat on my terrace on the roof. Beyond\n",
      "the line of trees southward I could see the open country chill and\n",
      "desolate. I could watch the sun rising over the sugar-cane in the East,\n",
      "beyond the clump of trees at the side of the village. Out of the deep\n",
      "shadow of those dark trees the village road suddenly appeared. It\n",
      "stretched forward, winding its way to some distant villages on the\n",
      "horizon, till it was lost in the grey of the mist.\n",
      "\n",
      "That morning it was difficult to say whether the sun had risen or not. A\n",
      "white fog was still clinging to the tops of the trees. I saw the Devotee\n",
      "walking through the blurred dawn, like a mist-wraith of the morning\n",
      "twilight. She was singing her chant to God, and sounding her cymbals.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thick haze lifted at last; and the sun, like the kindly grandsire of\n",
      "the village, took his seat amid all the work that was going on in home\n",
      "and field.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I had just settled down at my writing-table, to appease the hungry\n",
      "appetite of my editor in Calcutta, there came a sound of footsteps on\n",
      "the stair, and the Devotee, humming a tune to herself, entered, and\n",
      "bowed before me. I lifted my head from my papers.\n",
      "\n",
      "She said to me: \"My God, yesterday I took as sacred food what was left\n",
      "over from your meal.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I was startled, and asked her how she could do that.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh,\" she said, \"I waited at your door in the evening, while you were at\n",
      "dinner, and took some food from your plate when it was carried out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a surprise to me, for every one in the village knew that I had\n",
      "been to Europe, and had eaten with Europeans. I was a vegetarian, no\n",
      "doubt, but the sanctity of my cook would not bear investigation, and the\n",
      "orthodox regarded my food as polluted.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Devotee, noticing my sign of surprise, said: \"My God, why should I\n",
      "come to you at all, if I could not take your food?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I asked her what her own caste people would say. She told me she had\n",
      "already spread the news far and wide all over the village. The caste\n",
      "people had shaken their heads, but agreed that she must go her own way.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found out that the Devotee came from a good family in the country, and\n",
      "that her mother was well to-do, and desired to keep her daughter. But\n",
      "she preferred to be a mendicant. I asked her how she made her living.\n",
      "She told me that her followers had given her a piece of land, and that\n",
      "she begged her food from door to door. She said to me: \"The food which I\n",
      "get by begging is divine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After I had thought over what she said, I understood her meaning. When\n",
      "we get our food precariously as alms, we remember God the giver. But\n",
      "when we receive our food regularly at home, as a matter of course, we\n",
      "are apt to regard it as ours by right.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I had a great desire to ask her about her husband. But as she never\n",
      "mentioned him even indirectly, I did not question her.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found out very soon that the Devotee had no respect at all for that\n",
      "part of the village where the people of the higher castes lived.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They never give,\" she said, \"a single farthing to God's service; and\n",
      "yet they have the largest share of God's glebe. But the poor worship and\n",
      "starve.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I asked her why she did not go and live among these godless people,\n",
      "and help them towards a better life. \"That,\" I said with some unction,\n",
      "\"would be the highest form of divine worship.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I had heard sermons of this kind from time to time, and I am rather fond\n",
      "of copying them myself for the public benefit, when the chance comes.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Devotee was not at all impressed. She raised her big round eyes,\n",
      "and looked straight into mine, and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You mean to say that because God is with the sinners, therefore when\n",
      "you do them any service you do it to God? Is that so?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" I replied, \"that is my meaning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course,\" she answered almost impatiently, \"of course, God is with\n",
      "them: otherwise, how could they go on living at all? But what is that to\n",
      "me? My God is not there. My God cannot be worshipped among them; because\n",
      "I do not find Him there. I seek Him where I can find Him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As she spoke, she made obeisance to me. What she meant to say was really\n",
      "this. A mere doctrine of God's omnipresence does not help us. That God\n",
      "is all-pervading,--this truth may be a mere intangible abstraction, and\n",
      "therefore unreal to ourselves. Where I can see Him, there is His reality\n",
      "in my soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need not explain that all the while she showered her devotion on me\n",
      "she did it to me not as an individual. I was simply a vehicle of her\n",
      "divine worship. It was not for me either to receive it or to refuse it:\n",
      "for it was not mine, but God's.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the Devotee came again, she found me once more engaged with my\n",
      "books and papers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What have you been doing,\" she said, with evident vexation, \"that my\n",
      "God should make you undertake such drudgery? Whenever I come, I find you\n",
      "reading and writing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"God keeps his useless people busy,\" I answered; \"otherwise they would\n",
      "be bound to get into mischief. They have to do all the least necessary\n",
      "things in life. It keeps them out of trouble.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Devotee told me that she could not bear the encumbrances, with\n",
      "which, day by day, I was surrounded. If she wanted to see me, she was\n",
      "not allowed by the servants to come straight upstairs. If she wanted\n",
      "to touch my feet in worship, there were my socks always in the way. And\n",

      "That filled my very being. Then, after that, pray what was the use of my\n",

      "it a mere infatuation?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There were some flowers in my vase on the table. While she was there,\n",

      "saw him changing them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is that all?\" she exclaimed. \"Have you done with the flowers? Then give\n",
      "them to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She held the flowers tenderly in the cup of her hands, and began to gaze\n",
      "at them with bent head. After a few moments' silence she raised her head\n",
      "again, and said to me: \"You never look at these flowers; therefore they\n",
      "become stale to you. If you would only look into them, then your reading\n",
      "and writing would go to the winds.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She tied the flowers together in the end of her robe, and placed them,\n",
      "in an attitude of worship, on the top of her head, saying reverently:\n",

      "\n",
      "While she did this, I felt that flowers in our rooms do not receive\n",
      "their due meed of loving care at our hands. When we stick them in vases,\n",
      "they are more like a row of naughty schoolboys standing on a form to be\n",
      "punished.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Devotee came again the same evening, and sat by my feet on the\n",
      "terrace of the roof.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I gave away those flowers,\" she said, \"as I went from house to house\n",
      "this morning, singing God's name. Beni, the head man of our village,\n",
      "laughed at me for my devotion, and said: 'Why do you waste all\n",
      "this devotion on Him? Don't you know He is reviled up and down the\n",

      "burning fire. Why do they abuse you, my God?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The Devotee said: \"Now you see for yourself how little their hearts are\n",

      "\n",
      "\"When a man,\" I answered, \"has greed in his heart, he is always on\n",

      "business and household management he was able to hold his own. Because\n",
      "his needs were small, and his wants few, he could manage carefully\n",

      "would watch me with a restless look in his eyes. He had me very little\n",
      "to himself, and therefore his desire to be with me was always painfully\n",
      "eager. When I went each day to the river, he used to fret and stretch\n",
      "out his little arms to be taken with me. But the bathing ghal was my\n",

      "I saw my God in the form of that Guru. He used to come to take his meal\n",
      "at our house every morning. The first thought that would come to my mind\n",
      "on waking from sleep was that of his food as a sacred gift from God.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"When my husband saw my devotion to his Guru, his respect for me greatly\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Guru Thakur came to take his food that day, and asked my husband where\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Sometimes I am late in the evening in going to rest on account of\n",

      "operation?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At that he regained his good spirits: \"There are very few men,\" said\n",

      "shrinking.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "He looked at me gravely, and said: \"You are perfectly right. We men are\n",

      "I mistook the mixture for the lotion. And since the day I made the\n",
      "mistake, my eyes have grown steadily worse; and now an operation is\n",
      "needed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dada said to me: \"You were under your husband's treatment, and that is\n",
      "why I gave up coming to visit you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" I answered. \"In reality, I was secretly treating myself in\n",
      "accordance with your doctor's directions.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh! what lies we women have to tell! When we are mothers, we tell lies\n",
      "to pacify our children; and when we are wives, we tell lies to pacify\n",
      "the fathers of our children. We are never free from this necessity.\n",
      "\n",
      "My deception had the effect of bringing about a better feeling between\n",
      "my husband and Dada. Dada blamed himself for asking me to keep a secret\n",
      "from my husband: and my husband regretted that he had not taken my\n",
      "brother's advice at the first.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, with the consent of both, an English doctor came, and operated\n",
      "on my left eye. That eye, however, was too weak to bear the strain;\n",
      "and the last flickering glimmer of light went out. Then the other eye\n",
      "gradually lost itself in darkness.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day my husband came to my bedside. \"I cannot brazen it out before\n",
      "you any longer,\" said he, \"Kumo, it is I who have ruined your eyes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt that his voice was choking with tears, and so I took up his right\n",
      "hand in both of mine and said: \"Why! you did exactly what was right. You\n",
      "have dealt only with that which was your very own. Just imagine, if some\n",
      "strange doctor had come and taken away my eyesight. What consolation\n",
      "should I have had then? But now I can feel that all has happened for the\n",
      "best; and my great comfort is to know that it is at your hands I have\n",
      "lost my eyes. When Ramchandra found one lotus too few with which to\n",
      "worship God, he offered both his eyes in place of the lotus. And I hate\n",
      "dedicated my eyes to my God. From now, whenever you see something that\n",
      "is a joy to you, then you must describe it to me; and I will feed upon\n",
      "your words as a sacred gift left over from your vision.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not mean, of course, that I said all this there and then, for it is\n",
      "impossible to speak these things an the spur of the moment. But I used\n",
      "to think over words like these for days and days together. And when I\n",
      "was very depressed, or if at any time the light of my devotion became\n",
      "dim, and I pitied my evil fate, then I made my mind utter these\n",
      "sentences, one by one, as a child repeats a story that is told. And so I\n",
      "could breathe once more the serener air of peace and love.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the very time of our talk together, I said enough to show my husband\n",
      "what was in my heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Kumo,\" he said to me, \"the mischief I have done by my folly can never\n",
      "be made good. But I can do one thing. I can ever remain by your side,\n",
      "and try to make up for your want of vision as much as is in my power.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said I. \"That will never do. I shall not ask you to turn your\n",
      "house into an hospital for the blind. There is only one thing to be\n",
      "done, you must marry again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As I tried to explain to him that this was necessary, my voice broke\n",
      "a little. I coughed, and tried to hide my emotion, but he burst out\n",
      "saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Kumo, I know I am a fool, and a braggart, and all that, but I am not a\n",
      "villain! If ever I marry again, I swear to you--I swear to you the most\n",
      "solemn oath by my family god, Gopinath--may that most hated of all sins,\n",
      "the sin of parricide, fall on my head!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah! I should never, never have allowed him to swear that dreadful\n",
      "oath. But tears were choking my voice, and I could not say a word for\n",
      "insufferable joy. I hid my blind face in my pillows, and sobbed, and\n",
      "sobbed again. At last, when the first flood of my tears was over, I drew\n",
      "his head down to my breast.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah!\" said I, \"why did you take such a terrible oath? Do you think\n",
      "I asked you to marry again for your own sordid pleasure? No! I was\n",
      "thinking of myself, for she could perform those services which were mine\n",
      "to give you when I had my sight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Services!\" said he, \"services! Those can be done by servants. Do you\n",
      "think I am mad enough to bring a slave into my house, and bid her share\n",
      "the throne with this my Goddess?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As he said the word \"Goddess,\" he held up my face in his hands, and\n",
      "placed a kiss between my brows. At that moment the third eye of divine\n",
      "wisdom was opened, where he kissed me, and verily I had a consecration.\n",
      "\n",
      "I said in my own mind: \"It is well. I am no longer able to serve him in\n",
      "the lower world of household cares. But I shall rise to a higher\n",
      "region. I shall bring down blessings from above. No more lies! No more\n",
      "deceptions for me! All the littlenesses and hypocrisies of my former\n",
      "life shall be banished for ever!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That day, the whole day through, I felt a conflict going on within me.\n",
      "The joy of the thought, that after this solemn oath it was impossible\n",
      "for my husband to marry again, fixed its roots deep in my heart, and\n",
      "I could not tear them out. But the new Goddess, who had taken her new\n",
      "throne in me, said: \"The time might come when it would be good for\n",
      "your husband to break his oath and marry again.\" But the woman, who was\n",
      "within me, said: \"That may be; but all the same an oath is an oath, and\n",
      "there is no way out.\" The Goddess, who was within me, answered: \"That is\n",
      "no reason why you should exult over it.\" But the woman, who was within\n",
      "me, replied: \"What you say is quite true, no doubt; all the same he has\n",
      "taken his oath.\" And the same story went on again and again. At last\n",
      "the Goddess frowned in silence, and the darkness of a horrible fear came\n",
      "down upon me.\n",
      "\n",
      "My repentant husband would not let the servants do my work; he must do\n",
      "it all himself. At first it gave me unbounded delight to be dependent\n",
      "on him thus for every little thing. It was a means of keeping him by\n",
      "my side, and my desire to have him with me had become intense since my\n",
      "blindness. That share of his presence, which my eyes had lost, my other\n",
      "senses craved. When he was absent from my side, I would feel as if I\n",
      "were hanging in mid-air, and had lost my hold of all things tangible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Formerly, when my husband came back late from the hospital, I used\n",
      "to open my window and gaze at the road. That road was the link which\n",
      "connected his world with mine. Now when I had lost that link through my\n",
      "blindness, all my body would go out to seek him. The bridge that united\n",
      "us had given way, and there was now this unsurpassable chasm. When he\n",
      "left my side the gulf seemed to yawn wide open. I could only wait for\n",
      "the time when he should cross back again from his own shore to mine.\n",
      "\n",
      "But such intense longing and such utter dependence can never be good.\n",
      "A wife is a burden enough to a man, in all conscience, and to add to it\n",
      "the burden of this blindness was to make his life unbearable. I vowed\n",
      "that I would suffer alone, and never wrap my husband round in the folds\n",
      "of my all-pervading darkness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within an incredibly short space of time I managed to train myself to\n",
      "do all my household duties by the help of touch and sound and smell. In\n",
      "fact I soon found that I could get on with greater skill than before.\n",
      "For sight often distracts rather than helps us. And so it came to pass\n",
      "that, when these roving eyes of mine could do their work no longer,\n",
      "all the other senses took up their several duties with quietude and\n",
      "completeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I had gained experience by constant practice, I would not let my\n",
      "husband do any more household duties for me. He complained bitterly at\n",
      "first that I was depriving him of his penance.\n",
      "\n",
      "This did not convince me. Whatever he might say, I could feel that he\n",
      "had a real sense of relief when these household duties were over. To\n",
      "serve daily a wife who is blind can never make up the life of a man.\n",
      "\n",
      "II\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband at last had finished his medical course. He went away from\n",
      "Calcutta to a small town to practise as a doctor. There in the country I\n",
      "felt with joy, through all my blindness, that I was restored to the arms\n",
      "of my mother. I had left my village birthplace for Calcutta when I was\n",
      "eight years old. Since then ten years had passed away, and in the great\n",
      "city the memory of my village home had grown dim. As long as I had\n",
      "eyesight, Calcutta with its busy life screened from view the memory of\n",
      "my early days. But when I lost my eyesight I knew for the first time\n",
      "that Calcutta allured only the eyes: it could not fill the mind. And\n",
      "now, in my blindness, the scenes of my childhood shone out once more,\n",
      "like stars that appear one by one in the evening sky at the end of the\n",
      "day.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the beginning of November when we left Calcutta for Harsingpur.\n",
      "The place was new to me, but the scents and sounds of the countryside\n",
      "pressed round and embraced me. The morning breeze coming fresh from\n",
      "the newly ploughed land, the sweet and tender smell of the flowering\n",
      "mustard, the shepherd-boy's flute sounding in the distance, even the\n",
      "creaking noise of the bullock-cart, as it groaned over the broken\n",
      "village road, filled my world with delight. The memory of my past life,\n",
      "with all its ineffable fragrance and sound, became a living present to\n",
      "me, and my blind eyes could not tell me I was wrong. I went back, and\n",
      "lived over again my childhood. Only one thing was absent: my mother was\n",
      "not with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I could see my home with the large peepul trees growing along the edge\n",
      "of the village pool. I could picture in my mind's eye my old grandmother\n",
      "seated on the ground with her thin wisps of hair untied, warming her\n",
      "back in the sun as she made the little round lentil balls to be dried\n",
      "and used for cooking. But somehow I could not recall the songs she used\n",
      "to croon to herself in her weak and quavering voice. In the evening,\n",
      "whenever I heard the lowing of cattle, I could almost watch the figure\n",
      "of my mother going round the sheds with lighted lamp in her hand. The\n",
      "smell of the wet fodder and the pungent smoke of the straw fire would\n",
      "enter into my very heart. And in the distance I seemed to hear the\n",
      "clanging of the temple bell wafted up by the breeze from the river bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "Calcutta, with all its turmoil and gossip, curdles the heart. There,\n",
      "all the beautiful duties of life lose their freshness and innocence. I\n",
      "remember one day, when a friend of mine came in, and said to me: \"Kumo,\n",
      "why don't you feel angry? If I had been treated like you by my husband,\n",
      "I would never look upon his face again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She tried to make me indignant, because he had been so long calling in a\n",
      "doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My blindness,\" said I, \"was itself a sufficient evil. Why should I make\n",
      "it worse by allowing hatred to grow up against my husband?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "My friend shook her head in great contempt, when she heard such\n",
      "old-fashioned talk from the lips of a mere chit of a girl. She went away\n",
      "in disdain. But whatever might be my answer at the time, such words as\n",
      "these left their poison; and the venom was never wholly got out of the\n",
      "soul, when once they had been uttered.\n",
      "\n",
      "So you see Calcutta, with its never-ending gossip, does harden the\n",
      "heart. But when I came back to the country all my earlier hopes and\n",
      "faiths, all that I held true in life during childhood, became fresh and\n",
      "bright once more. God came to me, and filled my heart and my world. I\n",
      "bowed to Him, and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is well that Thou has taken away my eyes. Thou art with me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah! But I said more than was right. It was a presumption to say: \"Thou\n",
      "art with me.\" All we can say is this: \"I must be true to Thee.\" Even\n",
      "when nothing is left for us, still we have to go on living.\n",
      "\n",
      "III\n",
      "\n",
      "We passed a few happy months together. My husband gained some reputation\n",
      "in his profession as a doctor. And money came with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there is a mischief in money. I cannot point to any one event; but,\n",
      "because the blind have keener perceptions than other people, I could\n",
      "discern the change which came over my husband along with the increase of\n",
      "wealth.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had a keen sense of justice when he was younger, and had often told\n",
      "me of his great desire to help the poor when once he obtained a practice\n",
      "of his own. He had a noble contempt far those in his profession who\n",
      "would not feel the pulse of a poor patient before collecting his fee.\n",
      "But now I noticed a difference. He had become strangely hard. Once when\n",
      "a poor woman came, and begged him, out of charity, to save the life of\n",
      "her only child, he bluntly refused. And when I implored him myself to\n",
      "help her, he did his work perfunctorily.\n",
      "\n",
      "While we were less rich my husband disliked sharp practice in money\n",
      "matters. He was scrupulously honourable in such things. But since he\n",
      "had got a large account at the bank he was often closeted for hours with\n",
      "some scamp of a landlord's agent, for purposes which clearly boded no\n",
      "good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where has he drifted? What has become of this husband of mine,--the\n",
      "husband I knew before I was blind; the husband who kissed me that day\n",
      "between my brows, and enshrined me on the throne of a Goddess? Those\n",
      "whom a sudden gust of passion brings down to the dust can rise up again\n",
      "with a new strong impulse of goodness. But those who, day by day, become\n",
      "dried up in the very fibre of their moral being; those who by some outer\n",
      "parasitic growth choke the inner life by slow degrees,--such wench one\n",
      "day a deadness which knows no healing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The separation caused by blindness is the merest physical trifle. But,\n",
      "ah! it suffocates me to find that he is no longer with me, where he\n",
      "stood with me in that hour when we both knew that I was blind. That is a\n",
      "separation indeed!\n",
      "\n",
      "I, with my love fresh and my faith unbroken, have kept to the shelter of\n",
      "my heart's inner shrine. But my husband has left the cool shade of those\n",
      "things that are ageless and unfading. He is fast disappearing into the\n",
      "barren, waterless waste in his mad thirst for gold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes the suspicion comes to me that things not so bad as they seem:\n",
      "that perhaps I exaggerate because I am blind. It may be that, if my\n",
      "eyesight were unimpaired, I should have accepted world as I found it.\n",
      "This, at any rate, was the light in which my husband looked at all my\n",
      "moods and fancies.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day an old Musalman came to the house. He asked my husband to visit\n",
      "his little grand-daughter. I could hear the old man say: \"Baba, I am\n",
      "a poor man; but come with me, and Allah will do you good.\" My husband\n",
      "answered coldly: \"What Allah will do won't help matters; I want to know\n",
      "what you can do for me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When I heard it, I wondered in my mind why God had not made me deaf as\n",
      "well as blind. The old man heaved a deep sigh, and departed. I sent\n",
      "my maid to fetch him to my room. I met him at the door of the inner\n",
      "apartment, and put some money into his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Please take this from me,\" said I, \"for your little grand-daughter, and\n",
      "get a trustworthy doctor to look after her. And-pray for my husband.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But the whole of that day I could take no food at all. In the afternoon,\n",
      "when my husband got up from sleep, he asked me: \"Why do you look so\n",
      "pale?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I was about to say, as I used to do in the past: \"Oh! It's nothing \";\n",
      "but those days of deception were over, and I spoke to him plainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have been hesitating,\" I said, \"for days together to tell you\n",
      "something. It has been hard to think out what exactly it was I wanted to\n",
      "say. Even now I may not be able to explain what I had in my mind. But I\n",
      "am sure you know what has happened. Our lives have drifted apart.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband laughed in a forced manner, and said: \"Change is the law of\n",
      "nature.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I said to him: \"I know that. But there are some things that are\n",
      "eternal.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he became serious.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are many women,\" said he, \"who have a real cause for sorrow.\n",
      "There are some whose husbands do not earn money. There are others whose\n",
      "husbands do not love them. But you are making yourself wretched about\n",
      "nothing at all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then it became clear to me that my very blindness had conferred on me\n",
      "the power of seeing a world which is beyond all change. Yes! It is true.\n",
      "I am not like other women. And my husband will never understand me.\n",
      "\n",
      "IV\n",
      "\n",
      "Our two lives went on with their dull routine for some time. Then there\n",
      "was a break in the monotony. An aunt of my husband came to pay us a\n",
      "visit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing she blurted out after our first greeting was this:\n",
      "\"Well, Krum, it's a great pity you have become blind; but why do you\n",
      "impose your own affliction on your husband? You must get him to another\n",
      "wife.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was an awkward pause. If my husband had only said something in\n",
      "jest, or laughed in her face, all would have been over. But he stammered\n",
      "and hesitated, and said at last in a nervous, stupid way: \"Do you really\n",
      "think so? Really, Aunt, you shouldn't talk like that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "His aunt appealed to me. \"Was I wrong, Kumo?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I laughed a hollow laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Had not you better,\" said I, \"consult some one more competent to\n",
      "decide? The pickpocket never asks permission from the man whose pocket\n",
      "he is going to pick.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are quite right,\" she replied blandly. \"Abinash, my dear, let us\n",
      "have our little conference in private. What do you say to that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After a few days my husband asked her, in my presence, if she knew of\n",
      "any girl of a decent family who could come and help me in my household\n",
      "work. He knew quite well that I needed no help. I kept silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! there are heaps of them,\" replied his aunt. \"My cousin has a\n",
      "daughter who is just of the marriageable age, and as nice a girl as\n",
      "you could wish. Her people would be only too glad to secure you as a\n",
      "husband.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Again there came from him that forced, hesitating laugh, and he said:\n",
      "\"But I never mentioned marriage.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How could you expect,\" asked his aunt, \"a girl of decent family to come\n",
      "and live in your house without marriage?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He had to admit that this was reasonable, and remained nervously silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "I stood alone within the closed doors of my blindness after he had gone,\n",
      "and called upon my God and prayed: \"O God, save my husband.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When I was coming out of the household shrine from my morning worship a\n",
      "few days later, his aunt took hold of both my hands warmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Kumo, here is the girl,\" said she, \"we were speaking about the other\n",
      "day. Her name is Hemangini. She will be delighted to meet you. Hemo,\n",
      "come here and be introduced to your sister.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband entered the room at the same moment. He feigned surprise when\n",
      "he saw the strange girl, and was about to retire. But his aunt said:\n",
      "\"Abinash, my dear, what are you running away for? There is no need to\n",
      "do that. Here is my cousin's daughter, Hemangini, come to see you. Hemo,\n",
      "make your bow to him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As if taken quite by surprise, he began to ply his aunt with questions\n",
      "about the when and why and how of the new arrival.\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw the hollowness of the whole thing, and took Hemangini by the hand\n",
      "and led her to my own room. I gently stroked her face and arms and hair,\n",
      "and found that she was about fifteen years old, and very beautiful.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I felt her face, she suddenly burst out laughing and said: \"Why! what\n",
      "are you doing? Are you hypnotising me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That sweet ringing laughter of hers swept away in a moment all the dark\n",
      "clouds that stood between us. I threw my right arm about her neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear one,\" said I, \"I am trying to see you.\" And again I stroked her\n",
      "soft face with my left hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Trying to see me?\" she said, with a new burst of laughter. \"Am I like\n",
      "a vegetable marrow, grown in your garden, that you want to feel me all\n",
      "round to see how soft I am?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I suddenly bethought me that she did not know I had lost my sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sister, I am blind,\" said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was silent. I could feel her big young eyes, full of curiosity,\n",
      "peering into my face. I knew they were full of pity. Then she grew\n",
      "thoughtful and puzzled, and said, after a short pause:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! I see now. That was the reason your husband invited his aunt to\n",
      "come and stay here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No!\" I replied, \"you are quite mistaken. He did not ask her to come.\n",
      "She came of her own accord.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hemangini went off into a peal of laughter. \"That's just like my aunt,\"\n",
      "said she. \"Oh I wasn't it nice of her to come without any invitation?\n",
      "But now she's come, you won't get her to move for some time, I can\n",
      "assure you!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she paused, and looked puzzled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But why did father send me?\" she asked. \"Can you tell me that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The aunt had come into the room while we were talking. Hemangini said to\n",
      "her: \"When are you thinking of going back, Aunt?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The aunt looked very much upset.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a question to ask!\" said she, \"I've never seen such a restless\n",
      "body as you. We've only just come, and you ask when we're going back!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is all very well for you,\" Hemangini said, \"for this house belongs\n",
      "to your near relations. But what about me? I tell you plainly I can't\n",
      "stop here.\" And then she held my hand and said: \"What do you think,\n",
      "dear?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I drew her to my heart, but said nothing. The aunt was in a great\n",
      "difficulty. She felt the situation was getting beyond her control; so\n",
      "she proposed that she and her niece should go out together to bathe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No! we two will go together,\" said Hemangini, clinging to me. The aunt\n",
      "gave in, fearing opposition if she tried to drag her away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Going down to the river Hemangini asked me: \"Why don't you have\n",
      "children?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I was startled by her question, and answered: \"How can I tell? My God\n",
      "has not given me any. That is the reason.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No! That's not the reason,\" said Hemangini quickly. \"You must have\n",
      "committed some sin. Look at my aunt. She is childless. It must be\n",
      "because her heart has some wickedness. But what wickedness is in your\n",
      "heart?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The words hurt me. I have no solution to offer for the problem of evil.\n",
      "I sighed deeply, and said in the silence of my soul: \"My God! Thou\n",
      "knowest the reason.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Gracious goodness,\" cried Hemangini, \"what are you sighing for? No one\n",
      "ever takes me seriously.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And her laughter pealed across the river.\n",
      "\n",
      "V\n",
      "\n",
      "I found out after this that there were constant interruptions in my\n",
      "husband's professional duties. He refused all calls from a distance, and\n",
      "would hurry away from his patients, even when they were close at hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Formerly it was only during the mid-day meals and at night-time that he\n",
      "could come into the inner apartment. But now, with unnecessary anxiety\n",
      "for his aunt's comfort, he began to visit her at all hours of the day. I\n",
      "knew at once that he had come to her room, when I heard her shouting for\n",
      "Hemangini to bring in a glass of water. At first the girl would do what\n",
      "she was told; but later on she refused altogether.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the aunt would call, in an endearing voice: \"Hemo! Hemo!\n",
      "Hemangini.\" But the girl would cling to me with an impulse of pity. A\n",
      "sense of dread and sadness would keep her silent. Sometimes she would\n",
      "shrink towards me like a hunted thing, who scarcely knew what was\n",
      "coming.\n",
      "\n",
      "About this time my brother came down from Calcutta to visit me. I knew\n",
      "how keen his powers of observation were, and what a hard judge he was.\n",
      "I feared my husband would be put on his defence, and have to stand his\n",
      "trial before him. So I endeavoured to hide the true situation behind a\n",
      "mask of noisy cheerfulness. But I am afraid I overdid the part: it was\n",
      "unnatural for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband began to fidget openly, and asked how long my brother was\n",
      "going to stay. At last his impatience became little short of insulting,\n",
      "and my brother had no help for it but to leave. Before going he placed\n",
      "his hand on my head, and kept it there for some time. I noticed that his\n",
      "hand shook, and a tear fell from his eyes, as he silently gave me his\n",
      "blessing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I well remember that it was an evening in April, and a market-day.\n",
      "People who had come into the town were going back home from market.\n",
      "There was the feeling of an impending storm in the air; the smell of the\n",
      "wet earth and the moisture in the wind were all-pervading. I never keep\n",
      "a lighted lamp in my bedroom, when I am alone, lest my clothes should\n",
      "catch fire, or some accident happen. I sat on the floor in my dark room,\n",
      "and called upon the God of my blind world.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"O my Lord,\" I cried, \"Thy face is hidden. I cannot see. I am blind. I\n",
      "hold tight this broken rudder of a heart till my hands bleed. The waves\n",
      "have become too strong for me. How long wilt thou try me, my God, how\n",
      "long?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I kept my head prone upon the bedstead and began to sob. As I did so,\n",
      "I felt the bedstead move a little. The next moment Hemangini was by my\n",
      "side. She clung to my neck, and wiped my tears away silently. I do not\n",
      "know why she had been waiting that evening in the inner room, or why she\n",
      "had been lying alone there in the dusk. She asked me no question. She\n",
      "said no word. She simply placed her cool hand on my forehead, and kissed\n",
      "me, and departed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning Hemangini said to her aunt in my presence: \"If you want\n",
      "to stay on, you can. But I don't. I'm going away home with our family\n",
      "servant.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The aunt said there was no need for her to go alone, for she was going\n",
      "away also. Then smilingly and mincingly she brought out, from a plush\n",
      "case, a ring set with pearls.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look, Hemo,\" said she, \"what a beautiful ring my Abinash brought for\n",
      "you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hemangini snatched the ring from her hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look, Aunt,\" she answered quickly, \"just see how splendidly I aim.\" And\n",
      "she flung the ring into the tank outside the window.\n",
      "\n",
      "The aunt, overwhelmed with alarm, vexation, and surprise, bristled like\n",
      "a hedgehog. She turned to me, and held me by the hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Kumo,\" she repeated again and again, \"don't say a word about this\n",
      "childish freak to Abinash. He would be fearfully vexed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I assured her that she need not fear. Not a word would reach him about\n",
      "it from my lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day before starting for home Hemangini embraced me, and said:\n",
      "\"Dearest, keep me in mind; do not forget me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I stroked her face over and over with my fingers, and said: \"Sister, the\n",
      "blind have long memories.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I drew her head towards me, and kissed her hair and her forehead. My\n",
      "world suddenly became grey. All the beauty and laughter and tender\n",
      "youth, which had nestled so close to me, vanished when Hemangini\n",
      "departed. I went groping about with arms outstretched, seeking to find\n",
      "out what was left in my deserted world.\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband came in later. He affected a great relief now that they were\n",
      "gone, but it was exaggerated and empty. He pretended that his aunt's\n",
      "visit had kept him away from work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hitherto there had been only the one barrier of blindness between me\n",
      "and my husband. Now another barrier was added,--this deliberate silence\n",
      "about Hemangini. He feigned utter indifference, but I knew he was having\n",
      "letters about her.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was early in May. My maid entered my room one morning, and asked\n",
      "me: \"What is all this preparation going on at the landing on the river?\n",
      "Where is Master going?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I knew there was something impending, but I said to the maid: \"I can't\n",
      "say.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The maid did not dare to ask me any more questions. She sighed, and went\n",
      "away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Late that night my husband came to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have to visit a patient in the country,\" said he. \"I shall have to\n",
      "start very early to-morrow morning, and I may have to be away for two or\n",
      "three days.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I got up from my bed. I stood before him, and cried aloud: \"Why are you\n",
      "telling me lies?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband stammered out: \"What--what lies have I told you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I said: \"You are going to get married.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He remained silent. For some moments there was no sound in the room.\n",
      "Then I broke the silence:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Answer me,\" I cried. \"Say, yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He answered, \"Yes,\" like a feeble echo.\n",
      "\n",
      "I shouted out with a loud voice: \"No! I shall never allow you. I shall\n",
      "save you from this great disaster, this dreadful sin. If I fail in this,\n",
      "then why am I your wife, and why did I ever worship my God?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The room remained still as a stone. I dropped on the floor, and clung to\n",
      "my husband's knees.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What have I done?\" I asked. \"Where have I been lacking? Tell me truly.\n",
      "Why do you want another wife?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband said slowly: \"I will tell you the truth. I am afraid of\n",
      "you. Your blindness has enclosed you in its fortress, and I have now no\n",
      "entrance. To me you are no longer a woman. You are awful as my God. I\n",
      "cannot live my every day life with you. I want a woman--just an ordinary\n",
      "woman--whom I can be free to chide and coax and pet and scold.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, tear open my heart and see! What am I else but that,--just an\n",
      "ordinary woman? I am the same girl that I was when I was newly wed, a\n",
      "girl with all her need to believe, to confide, to worship.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not recollect exactly the words that I uttered. I only remember\n",
      "that I said: \"If I be a true wife, then, may God be my witness, you\n",
      "shall never do this wicked deed, you shall never break your oath. Before\n",
      "you commit such sacrilege, either I shall become a widow, or Hemangini\n",
      "shall die.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I fell down on the floor in a swoon. When I came to myself, it was\n",
      "still dark. The birds were silent. My husband had gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "All that day I sat at my worship in the sanctuary at the household\n",
      "shrine. In the evening a fierce storm, with thunder and lightning and\n",
      "rain, swept down upon the house and shook it. As I crouched before the\n",
      "shrine, I did not ask my God to save my husband from the storm, though\n",
      "he must have been at that time in peril on the river. I prayed that\n",
      "whatever might happen to me, my husband might be saved from this great\n",
      "sin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Night passed. The whole of the next day I kept my seat at worship. When\n",
      "it was evening there was the noise of shaking and beating at the door.\n",
      "When the door was broken open, they found me lying unconscious on the\n",
      "ground, and carried me to my room.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I came to myself at last, I heard some one whispering in my ear:\n",
      "\"Sister.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I found that I was lying in my room with my head on Hemangini's lap.\n",
      "When my head moved, I heard her dress rustle. It was the sound of bridal\n",
      "silk.\n",
      "\n",
      "O my God, my God! My prayer has gone unheeded! My husband has fallen!\n",
      "\n",
      "Hemangini bent her head low, and said in a sweet whisper: \"Sister,\n",
      "dearest, I have come to ask your blessing on our marriage.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At first my whole body stiffened like the trunk of a tree that has been\n",
      "struck by lightning. Then I sat up, and said, painfully, forcing myself\n",
      "to speak the words: \"Why should I not bless you? You have done no\n",
      "wrong.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hemangini laughed her merry laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wrong!\" said she. \"When you married it was right; and when I marry, you\n",
      "call it wrong!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I tried to smile in answer to her laughter. I said in my mind: \"My\n",
      "prayer is not the final thing in this world. His will is all. Let the\n",
      "blows descend upon my head; but may they leave my faith and hope in God\n",
      "untouched.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hemangini bowed to me, and touched my feet. \"May you be happy,\" said I,\n",
      "blessing her, \"and enjoy unbroken prosperity.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hemangini was still unsatisfied.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dearest sister,\" she said, \"a blessing for me is not enough. You must\n",
      "make our happiness complete. You must, with those saintly hands of\n",
      "yours, accept into your home my husband also. Let me bring him to you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I said: \"Yes, bring him to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A few moments later I heard a familiar footstep, and the question,\n",
      "\"Kumo, how are you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I started up, and bowed to the ground, and cried: \"Dada!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hemangini burst out laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You still call him elder brother?\" she asked. \"What nonsense! Call him\n",
      "younger brother now, and pull his ears and cease him, for he has married\n",
      "me, your younger sister.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I understood. My husband had been saved from that great sin. He had\n",
      "not fallen.\n",
      "\n",
      "I knew my Dada had determined never to marry. And, since my mother had\n",
      "died, there was no sacred wish of hers to implore him to wedlock. But I,\n",
      "his sister, by my sore need bad brought it to pass. He had married for\n",
      "my sake.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tears of joy gushed from my eyes, and poured down my cheeks. I tried,\n",
      "but I could not stop them. Dada slowly passed his fingers through my\n",
      "hair. Hemangini clung to me, and went on laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was lying awake in my bed for the best part of the night, waiting with\n",
      "straining anxiety for my husband's return. I could not imagine how he\n",
      "would bear the shock of shame and disappointment.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it was long past the hour of midnight, slowly my door opened. I sat\n",
      "up on my bed, and listened. They were the footsteps of my husband. My\n",
      "heart began to beat wildly. He came up to my bed, held my band in his.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your Dada,\" said he, \"has saved me from destruction. I was being\n",
      "dragged down and down by a moments madness. An infatuation had seized\n",
      "me, from which I seemed unable to escape. God alone knows what a load I\n",
      "was carrying on that day when I entered the boat. The storm came down\n",
      "on river, and covered the sky. In the midst of all fears I had a secret\n",
      "wish in my heart to be drowned, and so disentangle my life from the knot\n",
      "which I had tied it. I reached Mathurganj. There I heard the news which\n",
      "set me free. Your brother had married Hemangini. I cannot tell you with\n",
      "what joy and shame I heard it. I hastened on board the boat again. In\n",
      "that moment of self-revelation I knew that I could have no happiness\n",
      "except with you. You are a Goddess.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I laughed and cried at the same time, and said: \"No, no, no! I am not\n",
      "going to be a Goddess any longer I am simply your own little wife. I am\n",
      "an ordinary woman.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dearest,\" he replied, \"I have also something I want to say to you.\n",
      "Never again put me to shame by calling me your God.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On the next day the little town became joyous with sound of conch\n",
      "shells. But nobody made any reference to that night of madness, when all\n",

      "Once upon a time the Babus of Nayanjore were famous landholders. They\n",
      "were noted for their princely extravagance. They would tear off the\n",
      "rough border of their Dacca muslin, because it rubbed against their\n",
      "skin. They could spend many thousands of rupees over the wedding of a\n",
      "kitten. On a certain grand occasion it is alleged that in order to turn\n",
      "night into day they lighted numberless lamps and showered silver threads\n",
      "from the sky to imitate sunlight. Those were the days before the flood.\n",
      "The flood came. The line of succession among these old-world Babus, with\n",
      "their lordly habits, could not continue for long. Like a lamp with too\n",
      "many wicks burning, the oil flared away quickly, and the light went out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kailas Babu, our neighbour, is the last relic of this extinct\n",
      "magnificence. Before he grew up, his family had very nearly reached its\n",
      "lowest ebb. When his father died, there was one dazzling outburst of\n",
      "funeral extravagance, and then insolvency. The property was sold to\n",
      "liquidate the debt. What little ready money was left over was altogether\n",
      "insufficient to keep up the past ancestral splendours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kailas Babu left Nayanjore, and came to Calcutta. His son did not remain\n",
      "long in this world of faded glory. He died, leaving behind him an only\n",
      "daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Calcutta we are Kailas Baba's neighbours. Curiously enough our own\n",
      "family history is just the opposite to his. My father got his money by\n",
      "his own exertions, and prided himself on never spending a penny more\n",
      "than was needed. His clothes were those of a working man, and his\n",
      "hands also. He never had any inclination to earn the title of Baba by\n",
      "extravagant display, and I myself his only son, owe him gratitude for\n",
      "that. He gave me the very best education, and I was able to make my way\n",
      "in the world. I am not ashamed of the fact that I am a self-made man.\n",
      "Crisp bank-notes in my safe are dearer to me than a long pedigree in an\n",
      "empty family chest.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe this was why I disliked seeing Kailas Baba drawing his heavy\n",
      "cheques on the public credit from the bankrupt bank of his ancient Babu\n",
      "reputation I used to fancy that he looked down on me, because my father\n",
      "had earned money with his own hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ought to have noticed that no one showed any vexation towards Kailas\n",
      "Babu except myself. Indeed it would have been difficult to find an\n",
      "old man who did less harm than he. He was always ready with his kindly\n",
      "little acts of courtesy in times of sorrow and joy. He would join in all\n",
      "the ceremonies and religious observances of his neighbours. His familiar\n",
      "smile would greet young and old alike. His politeness in asking details\n",
      "about domestic affairs was untiring. The friends who met him in the\n",
      "street were perforce ready to be button-holed, while a long string of\n",
      "questions of this kind followed one another from his lips:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear friend, I am delighted to see you. Are quite well? How is\n",
      "Shashi? and Dada--is he all right? Do you know, I've only just heard that\n",
      "Madhu's son has got fever. How is he? Have you heard? And Hari Charan\n",
      "Babu--I've not seen him for a long time--I hope he is not ill. What's the\n",
      "matter with Rakkhal? And, er--er, how are the ladies of your family?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kailas Balm was spotlessly neat in his dress on all occasions, though\n",
      "his supply of clothes was sorely limited. Every day he used to air his\n",
      "shirts and vests and coats and trousers carefully, and put them out in\n",
      "the sun, along with his bed-quilt, his pillowcase, and the small carpet\n",
      "on which he always sat. After airing them he would shake them, and brush\n",
      "them, and put them on the rock. His little bits of furniture made his\n",
      "small room decent, and hinted that there was more in reserve if needed.\n",
      "Very often, for want of a servant, he would shut up his house for a\n",
      "while. Then he would iron out his shirts and linen with his own hands,\n",
      "and do other little menial tasks. After this he would open his door and\n",
      "receive his friends again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though Kailas Balm, as I have said, had lost all his landed property,\n",
      "he had still same family heirlooms left. There was a silver cruet for\n",
      "sprinkling scented water, a filigree box for otto-of-roses, a small gold\n",
      "salver, a costly ancient shawl, and the old-fashioned ceremonial dress\n",
      "and ancestral turban. These he had rescued with the greatest difficulty\n",
      "from the money-lenders' clutches. On every suitable occasion he would\n",
      "bring them out in state, and thus try to save the world-famed dignity\n",
      "of the Babus of Nayanjore. At heart the most modest of men, in his daily\n",
      "speech he regarded it as a sacred duty, owed to his rank, to give free\n",
      "play to his family pride. His friends would encourage this trait in his\n",
      "character with kindly good-humour, and it gave them great amusement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The neighbourhood soon learnt to call him their Thakur Dada\n",
      "(Grandfather). They would flock to his house, and sit with him for hours\n",
      "together. To prevent his incurring any expense, one or other of his\n",
      "friends would bring him tobacco, and say: \"Thakur Dada, this morning\n",
      "some tobacco was sent to me from Gaya. Do take it, and see how you like\n",
      "it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Thakur Dada would take it, and say it was excellent. He would then go on\n",
      "to tell of a certain exquisite tobacco which they once smoked in the old\n",
      "days at Nayanjore at the cost of a guinea an ounce.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wonder,\" he used to say, \"I wonder if any one would like to try it\n",
      "now. I have some left, and can get it at once.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Every one knew, that, if they asked for it, then somehow or other the\n",
      "key of the cupboard would be missing; or else Ganesh, his old family\n",
      "servant, had put it away somewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You never can be sure,\" he would add, \"where things go to when servants\n",
      "are about. Now, this Ganesh of mine,--I can't tell you what a fool he\n",
      "is, but I haven't the heart to dismiss him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ganesh, for the credit of the family, was quite ready to bear all the\n",
      "blame without a word.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the company usually said at this point: \"Never mind, Thakur Dada.\n",
      "Please don't trouble to look for it. This tobacco we're smoking will do\n",
      "quite well. The other would be too strong.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Thakur Dada would be relieved, and settle down again, and the talk\n",
      "would go on.\n",
      "\n",
      "When his guests got up to go away, Thakur Dada would accompany them to\n",
      "the door, and say to them on the door-step: \"Oh, by the way, when are\n",
      "you all coming to dine with me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "One or other of us would answer: \"Not just yet, Thakur Dada, not just\n",
      "yet. We'll fix a day later.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quite right,\" he would answer. \"Quite right. We had much better wait\n",
      "till the rains come. It's too hot now. And a grand rich dinner such as I\n",
      "should want to give you would upset us in weather like this.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But when the rains did come, every one careful not to remind him of his\n",
      "promise. If the subject was brought up, some friend would suggest\n",
      "gently that it was very inconvenient to get about when the rains were so\n",
      "severe, that it would be much better to wait till they were over. And so\n",
      "the game went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "His poor lodging was much too small for his position, and we used to\n",
      "condole with him about it. His friends would assure him they quite\n",
      "understood his difficulties: it was next to impossible to get a decent\n",
      "house in Calcutta. Indeed, they had all been looking out for years for\n",
      "a house to suit him, but, I need hardly add, no friend had been foolish\n",
      "enough to find one. Thakur Dada used to say, after a long sigh of\n",
      "resignation: \"Well, well, I suppose I shall have to put up with this\n",
      "house after all.\" Then he would add with a genial smile: \"But, you know,\n",
      "I could never bear to be away from my friends. I must be near you. That\n",
      "really compensates for everything.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Somehow I felt all this very deeply indeed. I suppose the real reason\n",
      "was, that when a man is young stupidity appears to him the worst of\n",
      "crimes. Kailas Babu was not really stupid. In ordinary business matters\n",
      "every one was ready to consult him.\n",
      "\n",
      "But with regard to Nayanjore his utterances were certainly void\n",
      "of common sense. Because, out of amused affection for him, no one\n",
      "contradicted his impossible statements, he refused to keep them in\n",
      "bounds. When people recounted in his hearing the glorious history of\n",
      "Nayanjore with absurd exaggerations he would accept all they said with\n",
      "the utmost gravity, and never doubted, even in his dreams, that any one\n",
      "could disbelieve it.\n",
      "\n",
      "II\n",
      "\n",
      "When I sit down and try to analyse the thoughts and feelings that I had\n",
      "towards Kailas Babu I see that there was a still deeper reason for my\n",
      "dislike. I will now explain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though I am the son of a rich man, and might have wasted time at\n",
      "college, my industry was such that I took my M.A. degree in Calcutta\n",
      "University when quite young. My moral character was flawless. In\n",
      "addition, my outward appearance was so handsome, that if I were to call\n",
      "myself beautiful, it might be thought a mark of self-estimation, but\n",
      "could not be considered an untruth.\n",
      "\n",
      "There could be no question that among the young men of Bengal I was\n",
      "regarded by parents generally as a very eligible match. I was myself\n",
      "quite clear on the point, and had determined to obtain my full value in\n",
      "the marriage market. When I pictured my choice, I had before my mind's\n",
      "eye a wealthy father's only daughter, extremely beautiful and highly\n",
      "educated. Proposals came pouring in to me from far and near; large sums\n",
      "in cash were offered. I weighed these offers with rigid impartiality, in\n",
      "the delicate scales of my own estimation. But there was no one fit to be\n",
      "my partner. I became convinced, with the poet Bhabavuti, that\n",
      "\n",
      "     In this worlds endless time and boundless space\n",
      "     One may be born at last to match my sovereign grace.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in this puny modern age, and this contracted space of modern Bengal,\n",
      "it was doubtful if the peerless creature existed as yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile my praises were sung in many tunes, and in different metres,\n",
      "by designing parents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether I was pleased with their daughters or not, this worship which\n",
      "they offered was never unpleasing. I used to regard it as my proper due,\n",
      "because I was so good. We are told that when the gods withhold their\n",
      "boons from mortals they still expect their worshippers to pay them\n",
      "fervent honour, and are angry if it is withheld. I had that divine\n",
      "expectance strongly developed in myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have already mentioned that Thakur Dada had an only grand-daughter.\n",
      "I had seen her many times, but had never mistaken her for beautiful. No\n",
      "thought had ever entered my mind that she would be a possible partner\n",
      "for myself. All the same, it seemed quite certain to me that some day ox\n",
      "other Kailas Babu would offer her, with all due worship, as an oblation\n",
      "at my shrine. Indeed-this was the secret of my dislike-I was thoroughly\n",
      "annoyed that he had not done it already.\n",
      "\n",
      "I heard he had told his friends that the Babus of Nayanjore never craved\n",
      "a boon. Even if the girl remained unmarried, he would not break the\n",
      "family tradition. It was this arrogance of his that made me angry. My\n",
      "indignation smouldered for some time. But I remained perfectly silent,\n",
      "and bore it with the utmost patience, because I was so good.\n",
      "\n",
      "As lightning accompanies thunder, so in my character a flash of\n",
      "humour was mingled with the mutterings of my wrath. It was, of course,\n",
      "impossible for me to punish the old man merely to give vent to my rage;\n",
      "and for a long time I did nothing at all. But suddenly one day such an\n",
      "amusing plan came into my head, that I could not resist the temptation\n",
      "of carrying it into effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have already said that many of Kailas Babu's friends used to flatter\n",
      "the old man's vanity to the full. One, who was a retired Government\n",
      "servant, had told him that whenever he saw the Chota Lord Sahib he\n",
      "always asked for the latest news about the Babus of Nayanjore, and the\n",
      "Chota Lard had been heard to say that in all Bengal the only really\n",
      "respectable families were those of the Maharaja of Burdwan and the Babus\n",
      "of Nayanjore. When this monstrous falsehood was told to Kailas Balm\n",
      "he was extremely gratified, and often repeated the story. And wherever\n",
      "after that he met this Government servant in company he would ask, along\n",
      "with other questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! er--by the way, how is the Chota Lord Sahib? Quite well, did you\n",
      "say? Ah, yes, I am so delighted to hear it I And the dear Mem Sahib, is\n",
      "she quite well too? Ah, yes! and the little children-are they quite\n",
      "well also? Ah, yes I that's very goad news! Be sure and give them my\n",
      "compliments when you see them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kailas Balm would constantly express his intention of going some day and\n",
      "paying a visit to the Sahib.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it may be taken for granted that many Chota Lords and Burro Lords\n",
      "also would come and go, and much water would pass down the Hoogly,\n",
      "before the family coach of Nayanjore would be furnished up to pay a\n",
      "visit to Government House.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day I took Kailas Babu aside, and told him in a whisper: \"Thakur\n",
      "Dada, I was at the Levee yesterday, and the Chota Lord happened to\n",
      "mention the Babes of Nayanjore. I told him that Kailas Balm had come to\n",
      "town. Do you know, he was terribly hurt because you hadn't called. He\n",
      "told me he was going to put etiquette on one side, and pay you a private\n",
      "visit himself this very afternoon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anybody else could have seen through this plot of mine in a moment. And,\n",
      "if it had been directed against another person, Kailas Balm would have\n",
      "understood the joke. But after all he had heard from his friend the\n",
      "Government servant, and after all his own exaggerations, a visit from\n",
      "the Lieutenant-Governor seemed the most natural thing in the world. He\n",
      "became highly nervous and excited at my news. Each detail of the coming\n",
      "visit exercised him greatly--most of all his own ignorance of English.\n",
      "How on earth was that difficulty to be met? I told him there was\n",
      "no difficulty at all: it was aristocratic not to know English: and,\n",
      "besides, the Lieutenant-Governor always brought an interpreter with him,\n",
      "and he had expressly mentioned that this visit was to be private.\n",
      "\n",
      "About mid-day, when most of our neighbours are at work, and the rest are\n",
      "asleep, a carriage and pair stopped before the lodging of Kailas Babu.\n",
      "Two flunkeys in livery came up the stairs, and announced in a loud\n",
      "voice, \"The Chota Lord Sahib hoe arrived.\" Kailas Babu was ready,\n",
      "waiting for him, in his old-fashioned ceremonial robes and ancestral\n",
      "turban, and Ganesh was by his side, dressed in his master's best suit\n",
      "of clothes for the occasion. When the Chota Lord Sahib was announced,\n",
      "Kailas Balm ran panting and puffing and trembling to the door, and led\n",
      "in a friend of mine, in disguise, with repeated salaams, bowing low at\n",
      "each step, and walking backward as best he could. He had his old family\n",
      "shawl spread over a hard wooden chair, and he asked the Lord Sahib to\n",
      "be seated. He then made a high flown speech in Urdu, the ancient Court\n",
      "language of the Sahibs, and presented on the golden salver a string\n",
      "of gold mohurs, the last relics of his broken fortune. The old family\n",
      "servant Ganesh, with an expression of awe bordering on terror, stood\n",
      "behind with the scent-sprinkler, drenching the Lord Sahib, touching him\n",
      "gingerly from time to time with the otto-of-roses from the filigree box.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kailas Babu repeatedly expressed his regret at not being able to receive\n",
      "His Honour Bahadur with all the ancestral magnificence of his own family\n",
      "estate at Nayanjore. There he could have welcomed him properly with due\n",
      "ceremonial. But in Calcutta he was a mere stranger and sojourner-in fact\n",
      "a fish out of water.\n",
      "\n",
      "My friend, with his tall silk hat on, very gravely nodded. I need hardly\n",
      "say that according to English custom the hat ought to have been removed\n",
      "inside the room. But my friend did not dare to take it off for fear of\n",
      "detection; and Kailas Balm and his old servant Ganesh were sublimely\n",
      "unconscious of the breach of etiquette.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a ten minutes' interview, which consisted chiefly of nodding the\n",
      "head, my friend rose to his feet to depart. The two flunkeys in livery,\n",
      "as had been planned beforehand, carried off in state the string of\n",
      "gold mohurs, the gold salver, the old ancestral shawl, the silver\n",
      "scent-sprinkler, and the otto-of-roses filigree box; they placed them\n",
      "ceremoniously in the carriage. Kailas Babu regarded this as the usual\n",
      "habit of Chota Lard Sahibs.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was watching all the while from the next room. My sides were aching\n",
      "with suppressed laughter. When I could hold myself in no longer, I\n",
      "rushed into a further room, suddenly to discover, in a corner, a young\n",
      "girl sobbing as if her heart would break. When she saw my uproarious\n",
      "laughter she stood upright in passion, flashing the lightning of her big\n",
      "dark eyes in mine, and said with a tear-choked voice:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell me! What harm has my grandfather done to you? Why have you come to\n",
      "deceive him? Why have you come here? Why--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She could say no more. She covered her face with her hands, and broke\n",
      "into sobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "My laughter vanished in a moment. It had never occurred to me that there\n",
      "was anything but a supremely funny joke in this act of mine, and here I\n",
      "discovered that I had given the cruelest pain to this tenderest little\n",
      "heart. All the ugliness of my cruelty rose up to condemn me. I slunk out\n",
      "of the room in silence, like a kicked dog.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hitherto I had only looked upon Kusum, the grand-daughter of Kailas\n",
      "Babu, as a somewhat worthless commodity in the marriage market, waiting\n",
      "in vain to attract a husband. But now I found, with a shock of surprise,\n",
      "that in the corner of that room a human heart was beating.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole night through I had very little sleep. My mind was in a\n",
      "tumult. On the next day, very early in the morning, I took all those\n",
      "stolen goods back to Kailas Babe's lodgings, wishing to hand them over\n",
      "in secret to the servant Ganesh. I waited outside the door, and, not\n",
      "finding any one, went upstairs to Kailas Babu's room. I heard from the\n",
      "passage Kusum asking her grandfather in the most winning voice: \"Dada,\n",
      "dearest, do tell me all that the Chota Lord Sahib said to you yesterday.\n",
      "Don't leave out a single word. I am dying to hear it all over again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And Dada needed no encouragement. His face beamed over with pride as he\n",
      "related all manner of praises, which the Lard Sahib had been good enough\n",
      "to utter concerning the ancient families of Nayanjore. The girl was\n",
      "seated before him, looking up into his face, and listening with rapt\n",
      "attention. She was determined, out of love for the old man, to play her\n",
      "part to the full.\n",
      "\n",
      "My heart was deeply touched, and tears came to my eyes. I stood there\n",
      "in silence in the passage, while Thakur Dada finished all his\n",
      "embellishments of the Chota Lord Sahib's wonderful visit. When he left\n",
      "the room at last, I took the stolen goods and laid them at the feet of\n",
      "the girl and came away without a word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later in the day I called again to see Kailas Balm himself. According to\n",
      "our ugly modern custom, I had been in the habit of making no greeting at\n",
      "all to this old man when I came into the room. But on this day I made a\n",
      "low bow, and touched his feet. I am convinced the old man thought that\n",
      "the coming of the Chota Lord Sahib to his house was the cause of my new\n",
      "politeness. He was highly gratified by it, and an air of benign severity\n",
      "shone from his eyes. His friends had flocked in, and he had\n",
      "already begun to tell again at full length the story of the\n",
      "Lieutenant-Governor's visit with still further adornments of a most\n",
      "fantastic kind. The interview was already becoming an epic, both in\n",
      "quality and in length.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the other visitors had taken their leave, I made my proposal to the\n",
      "old man in a humble manner. I told him that, \"though I could never for a\n",
      "moment hope to be worthy of marriage connection with such an illustrious\n",
      "family, yet... etc. etc.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When I made clear my proposal of marriage, the old man embraced me, and\n",
      "broke out in a tumult of joy: \"I am a poor man, and could never have\n",
      "expected such great good fortune.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That was the first and last time in his life that Kailas Babu confessed\n",
      "to being poor. It was also the first and last time in his life that he\n",
      "forgot, if only for a single moment, the ancestral dignity that belongs\n",

      "love. Love cannot prove its claim by any document which society accepts,\n",
      "and does not wish to prove it; it merely worships with double passion\n",
      "its life's uncertain treasure. Thus all the widow's thwarted love went\n",
      "out to wards this little child. One night in Sraban Kadambini died\n",
      "suddenly. For some reason her heart stopped beating. Everywhere else the\n",
      "world held on its course; only in this gentle little breast, suffering\n",
      "with love, the watch of time stood still for ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lest they should be harassed by the poike, four of the zemindar's\n",
      "Brahmin servants took away the body, without ceremony, to be burned. The\n",
      "burning-ground of Ranihat was very far from the village. There was a\n",
      "hut beside a tank, a huge banian near it, and nothing more. Formerly a\n",
      "river, now completely dried up, ran through the ground, and part of\n",
      "the watercourse had been dug out to make a tank for the performance of\n",
      "funeral rites. The people considered the tank as part of the river and\n",
      "reverenced it as such.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking the body into the hut, the four men sat down to wait for the\n",
      "wood. The time seemed so long that two of the four grew restless, and\n",
      "went to see why it did not come. Nitai and Gurucharan being gone, Bidhu\n",
      "and Banamali remained to watch over the body.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a dark night of Sraban. Heavy clouds hung In a starless sky.\n",
      "The two men sat silent in the dark room. Their matches and lamp were\n",
      "useless. The matches were damp, and would not light, for all their\n",
      "efforts, and the lantern went out.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a long silence, one said: \"Brother, it would be good if we had a\n",
      "bowl of tobacco. In our hurry we brought none.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The other answered: \"I can run and bring all we want.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Understanding why Banarnali wanted to go (From fear of ghosts, the\n",
      "burning-ground being considered haunted.), Bidhu said: \"I daresay!\n",
      "Meanwhile, I suppose I am to sit here alone!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Conversation ceased again. Five minutes seemed like an hour. In their\n",
      "minds they cursed the two, who had gone to fetch the wood, and they\n",
      "began to suspect that they sat gossiping in some pleasant nook. There\n",
      "was no sound anywhere, except the incessant noise of frogs and crickets\n",
      "from the tank. Then suddenly they fancied that the bed shook slightly,\n",
      "as if the dead body had turned on its side. Bidhu and Banamali trembled,\n",
      "and began muttering: \"Ram, Ram.\" A deep sigh was heard in the room. In a\n",
      "moment the watchers leapt out of the hut, and raced for the village.\n",
      "\n",
      "After running about three miles, they met their colleagues coming back\n",
      "with a lantern. As a matter of fact, they had gone to smoke, and knew\n",
      "nothing about the wood. But they declared that a tree had been cut down,\n",
      "and that, when it was split up, it would be brought along at once. Then\n",
      "Bidhu and Banamali told them what had happened in the hut. Nitai and\n",
      "Gurucharan scoffed at the story, and abused Bidhu and Banamali angrily\n",
      "for leaving their duty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without delay all four returned to the hut. As they entered, they saw\n",
      "at once that the body was gone; nothing but an empty bed remained. They\n",
      "stared at one another. Could a jackal have taken it? But there was no\n",
      "scrap of clothing anywhere. Going outside, they saw that on the mud\n",
      "that had collected at the door of the but there were a woman's tiny\n",
      "footprints, newly made. Saradasankar was no fool, and they could hardly\n",
      "persuade him to believe in this ghost story. So after much discussion\n",
      "the four decided that it would be best to say that the body had been\n",
      "burnt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Towards dawn, when the men with the wood arrived they were told that,\n",
      "owing to their delay, the work had been done without them; there had\n",
      "been some wood in the but after all. No one was likely to question this,\n",
      "since a dead body is not such a valuable property that any one would\n",
      "steal it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "II\n",
      "\n",
      "Every one knows that, even when there is no sign, life is often secretly\n",
      "present, and may begin again in an apparently dead body. Kadambini was\n",
      "not dead; only the machine of her life had for some reason suddenly\n",
      "stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "When consciousness returned, she saw dense darkness on all sides. It\n",
      "occurred to her that she was not lying in her usual place. She called\n",
      "out \"Sister,\" but no answer came from the darkness. As she sat up,\n",
      "terror-stricken, she remembered her death-bed, the sudden pain at her\n",
      "breast, the beginning of a choking sensation. Her elder sister-in-law\n",
      "was warming some milk for the child, when Kadambini became faint, and\n",
      "fell on the bed, saying with a choking voice: \"Sister, bring the child\n",
      "here. I am worried.\" After that everything was black, as when an inkpot\n",
      "is upset over an exercise-book. Kadambini's memory and consciousness,\n",
      "all the letters of the world's book, in a moment became formless. The\n",
      "widow could not remember whether the child, in the sweet voice of love,\n",
      "called her \"Auntie,\" as if for the last time, or not; she could not\n",
      "remember whether, as she left the world she knew for death's endless\n",
      "unknown journey, she had received a parting gift of affection, love's\n",
      "passage-money for the silent land. At first, I fancy, she thought the\n",
      "lonely dark place was the House of Yama, where there is nothing to see,\n",
      "nothing to hear, nothing to do, only an eternal watch. But when a cold\n",
      "damp wind drove through the open door, and she heard the croaking of\n",
      "frogs, she remembered vividly and in a moment all the rains of her short\n",
      "life, and could feel her kinship with the earth. Then came a flash\n",
      "of lightning, and she saw the tank, the banian, the great plain, the\n",
      "far-off trees. She remembered how at full moon she had sometimes come\n",
      "to bathe in this tank, and how dreadful death had seemed when she saw a\n",
      "corpse on the burning-ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her first thought was to return home. But then she reflected: \"I am\n",
      "dead. How can I return home? That would bring disaster on them. I have\n",
      "left the kingdom of the living; I am my own ghost!\" If this were not so,\n",
      "she reasoned, how could she have got out of Saradasankar's well-guarded\n",
      "zenana, and come to this distant burningground at midnight? Also, if her\n",
      "funeral rites had not been finished, where had the men gone who should\n",
      "burn her? Recalling her death-moment in Saradasankar's brightly-lit\n",
      "house, she now found herself alone in a distant, deserted, dark burning.\n",
      "ground. Surely she was no member of earthly society! Surely she was a\n",
      "creature of horror, of ill-omen, her own ghost!\n",
      "\n",
      "At this thought, all the bonds were snapped which bound her to the\n",
      "world. She felt that she had marvellous strength, endless freedom. She\n",
      "could do what she liked, go where she pleased. Mad with the inspiration\n",
      "of this new idea, she rushed from the but like a gust of wind, and stood\n",
      "upon the burning ground. All trace of shame or fear had left her.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as she walked on and on, her feet grew tired, her body weak.\n",
      "The plain stretched on endlessly; here and there were paddy-fields;\n",
      "sometimes she found herself standing knee-deep in water.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the first glimmer of dawn she heard one or two birds cry from the\n",
      "bamboo-clumps by the distant houses. Then terror seized her. She could\n",
      "not tell in what new relation she stood to the earth and to living folk.\n",
      "So long as she had been on the plain, on the burning-ground, covered by\n",
      "the dark night of Sraban, so long she had been fearless, a denizen of\n",
      "her own kingdom. By daylight the homes of men filled her with fear. Men\n",
      "and ghosts dread each other, for their tribes inhabit different banks of\n",
      "the river of death.\n",
      "\n",
      "III\n",
      "\n",
      "Her clothes were clotted in the mud; strange thoughts and walking by\n",
      "night had given her the aspect of a madwoman; truly, her apparition was\n",
      "such that folk might have been afraid of her, and children might have\n",
      "stoned her or run away. Luckily, the first to catch sight of her was a\n",
      "traveller. He came up, and said: \"Mother, you look a respectable woman.\n",
      "Wherever are you going, alone and in this guise?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadambini, unable to collect her thoughts, stared at him in silence.\n",
      "She could not think that she was still in touch with the world, that\n",
      "she looked like a respectable woman, that a traveller was asking her\n",
      "questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again the min said: \"Come, mother, I will see you home. Tell me where\n",
      "you live.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadambini thought. To return to her father-in-law's house would be\n",
      "absurd, and she had no father's house. Then she remembered the friend of\n",
      "her childhood. She had not seen Jogmaya since the days of her youth,\n",
      "but from time to time they had exchanged letters. Occasionally there had\n",
      "been quarrels between them, as was only right, since Kadambini wished to\n",
      "make it dear that her love for Jogmaya was unbounded, while her friend\n",
      "complained that Kadambini did not return a love equal to her own. They\n",
      "were both sure that, if they once met, they would be inseparable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadambini said to the traveller: \"I will go to Sripati's house at\n",
      "Nisindapur.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As he was going to Calcutta, Nisindapur, though not near, was on his\n",
      "way. So he took Kadambini to Sripati s house, and the friends met\n",
      "again. At first they did not recognise one another, but gradually each\n",
      "recognised the features of the other's childhood.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What luck!\" said Jogmaya. \"I never dreamt that I should see you again.\n",
      "But how hate you come here, sister? Your father-in-law's folk surely\n",
      "didn't let you go!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadambini remained silent, and at last said: \"Sister, do not ask about\n",
      "my father-in-law. Give me a corner, and treat me as a servant: I will do\n",
      "your work.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What?\" cried Jogmaya. \"Keep you like a servant! Why, you are my closest\n",
      "friend, you are my--\" and so on and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then Sripati came in. Kadambini stared at him for some time, and\n",
      "then went out very slowly. She kept her head uncovered, and showed not\n",
      "the slightest modesty or respect. Jogmaya, fearing that Sripati would\n",
      "be prejudiced against her friend, began an elaborate explanation. But\n",
      "Sripati, who readily agreed to anything Jogmaya said, cut short her\n",
      "story, and left his wife uneasy in her mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadambini had come, but she was not at one with her friend: death was\n",
      "between them. She could feel no intimacy for others so long as her\n",
      "existence perplexed her and consciousness remained. Kadambini would look\n",
      "at Jogmaya, and brood. She would think: \"She has her husband and her\n",
      "work, she lives in a world far away from mine. She shares affection and\n",
      "duty with the people of the world; I am an empty shadow. She is among\n",
      "the living; I am in eternity.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jogmaya also was uneasy, but could not explain why. Women do not love\n",
      "mystery, because, though uncertainty may be transmuted into poetry, into\n",
      "heroism, into scholarship, it cannot be turned to account in household\n",
      "work. So, when a woman cannot understand a thing, she either destroys\n",
      "and forgets it, or she shapes it anew for her own use; if she fails to\n",
      "deal with it in one of these ways, she loses her temper with it. The\n",
      "greater Kadambini's abstraction became, the more impatient was Jogmaya\n",
      "with her, wondering what trouble weighed upon her mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then a new danger arose. Kadambini was afraid of herself; yet she could\n",
      "not flee from herself. Those who fear ghosts fear those who are behind\n",
      "them; wherever they cannot see there is fear. But Kadambini's chief\n",
      "terror lay in herself, for she dreaded nothing external. At the dead of\n",
      "night, when alone in her room, she screamed; in the evening, when she\n",
      "saw her shadow in the lamp-light, her whole body shook. Watching her\n",
      "fearfulness, the rest of the house fell into a sort of terror. The\n",
      "servants and Jogmaya herself began to see ghosts.\n",
      "\n",
      "One midnight, Kadambini came out from her bedroom weeping, and wailed at\n",
      "Jogmaya's door: \"Sister, sister, let me lie at your feet! Do not put me\n",
      "by myself!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jogmaya's anger was no less than her fear. She would have liked to drive\n",
      "Kadambini from the house that very second. The good-natured Sripati,\n",
      "after much effort, succeeded in quieting their guest, and put her in the\n",
      "next room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next day Sripati was unexpectedly summoned to his wife's apartments.\n",
      "She began to upbraid him: \"You, do you call yourself a man? A woman runs\n",
      "away from her father-in-law, and enters your house; a month passes,\n",
      "and you haven't hinted that she should go away, nor have I heard the\n",
      "slightest protest from you. I should cake it as a favour if you would\n",
      "explain yourself. You men are all alike.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Men, as a race, have a natural partiality for womankind in general,\n",
      "foe which women themselves hold them accountable. Although Sripati\n",
      "was prepared to touch Jogmaya's body, and swear that his kind feeling\n",
      "towards the helpless but beautiful Kadambini was no whit greater than it\n",
      "should be, he could not prove it by his behaviour. He thought that her\n",
      "father-in-law's people must have treated this forlorn widow abominably,\n",
      "if she could bear it no longer, and was driven to take refuge with\n",
      "him. As she had neither father nor mother, how could he desert her? So\n",
      "saying, he let the matter drop, far he had no mind to distress Kadambini\n",
      "by asking her unpleasant questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "His wife, then, tried other means of her sluggish lord, until at last\n",
      "he saw that for the sake of peace he must send word to Kadambini's\n",
      "father-in-law. The result of a letter, he thought, might not be\n",
      "satisfactory; so he resolved to go to Ranihat, and act on what he\n",
      "learnt.\n",
      "\n",
      "So Sripati went, and Jogmaya on her part said to Kadambini \"Friend, it\n",
      "hardly seems proper for you to stop here any longer. What will people\n",
      "say?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadambini stared solemnly at Jogmaya, and said: \"What have I to do with\n",
      "people?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jogmaya was astounded. Then she said sharply: \"If you have nothing to\n",
      "do with people, we have. How can we explain the detention of a woman\n",
      "belonging to another house?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadambini said: \"Where is my father-in-law's house?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Confound it!\" thought Jogmaya. \"What will the wretched woman say next?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Very slowly Kadambini said: \"What have I to do with you? Am I of the\n",
      "earth? You laugh, weep, love; each grips and holds his own; I merely\n",
      "look. You are human, I a shadow. I cannot understand why God has kept me\n",
      "in this world of yours.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So strange were her look and speech that Jogmaya understood something of\n",
      "her drift, though not all. Unable either to dismiss her, or to ask her\n",
      "any more questions, she went away, oppressed with thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "IV\n",
      "\n",
      "It was nearly ten o'clock at night when Sripati returned from Ranihat.\n",
      "The earth was drowned in torrents of rain. It seemed that the downpour\n",
      "would never stop, that the night would never end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jogmaya asked: \"Well?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've lots to say, presently.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So saying, Sripati changed his clothes, and sat down to supper; then he\n",
      "lay dawn for a smoke. His mind was perplexed.\n",
      "\n",
      "His wife stilled her curiosity for a long time; then she came to his\n",
      "couch and demanded: \"What did you hear?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That you have certainly made a mistake.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jogmaya was nettled. Women never make mistakes, or, if they do, a\n",
      "sensible man never mentions them; it is better to take them on his own\n",
      "shoulders. Jogmaya snapped: \"May I be permitted to hear how?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sripati replied: \"The woman you have taken into your house is not your\n",
      "Kadambini.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hearing this, she was greatly annoyed, especially since it was her\n",
      "husband who said it. \"What! I don't know my own friend? I must come to\n",
      "you to recognise her! You are clever, indeed!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sripati explained that there was no need to quarrel about his\n",
      "cleverness. He could prove what he said. There was no doubt that\n",
      "Jogmaya's Kadambini was dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jogmaya replied: \"Listen! You've certainly made some huge mistake.\n",
      "You've been to the wrong house, or are confused as to what you have\n",
      "heard. Who told you to go yourself? Write a letter, and everything will\n",
      "be cleared up.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sripati was hurt by his wife's lack of faith in his executive ability;\n",
      "he produced all sorts of proof, without result. Midnight found them\n",
      "still asserting and contradicting. Although they were both agreed now\n",
      "that Kadambini should be got out of the house, although Sripati believed\n",
      "that their guest had deceived his wife all the time by a pretended\n",
      "acquaintance, and Jogmaya that she was a prostitute, yet in the present\n",
      "discussion neither would acknowledge defeat. By degrees their voices\n",
      "became so loud that they forgot that Kadambini was sleeping in the next\n",
      "room.\n",
      "\n",
      "The one said: \"We're in a nice fix! I tell you, I heard it with my own\n",
      "ears!\" And the other answered angrily: \"What do I care about that? I can\n",
      "see with my own eyes, surely.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At length Jogmaya said: \"Very well. Tell me when Kadambini died.\" She\n",
      "thought that if she could find a discrepancy between the day of death\n",
      "and the date of some letter from Kadambini, she could prove that Sripati\n",
      "erred.\n",
      "\n",
      "He told her the date of Kadambini's death, and they both saw that it\n",
      "fell on the very day before she came to their house. Jogmaya's heart\n",
      "trembled, even Sripati was not unmoved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then the door flew open; a damp wind swept in and blew the lamp\n",
      "out. The darkness rushed after it, and filled the whole house. Kadambini\n",
      "stood in the room. It was nearly one o'clock, the rain was pelting\n",
      "outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadambini spoke: \"Friend, I am your Kadambini, but I am no longer\n",
      "living. I am dead.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jogmaya screamed with terror; Sripati could speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, save in being dead, I have done you no wrong. If I have no place\n",
      "among the living, I have none among the dead. Oh! whither shall I go?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Crying as if to wake the sleeping Creator in the dense night of rain,\n",
      "she asked again: \"Oh! whither shall I go?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So saying Kadambini left her friend fainting in the dark house, and went\n",
      "out into the world, seeking her own place.\n",
      "\n",
      "V\n",
      "\n",
      "It is hard to say how Kadambini reached Ranihat. At first she showed\n",
      "herself to no one, but spent the whole day in a ruined temple, starving.\n",
      "When the untimely afternoon of the rains was pitch-black, and people\n",
      "huddled into their houses for fear of the impending storm, then\n",
      "Kadambini came forth. Her heart trembled as she reached her\n",
      "father-in-law's house; and when, drawing a thick veil over her face,\n",
      "she entered, none of the doorkeepers objected, since they took her for a\n",
      "servant. And the rain was pouring down, and the wind howled.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mistress, Saradasankar's wife, was playing cards with her widowed\n",
      "sister. A servant was in the kitchen, the sick child was sleeping in the\n",
      "bedroom. Kadambini, escaping every one's notice, entered this room. I do\n",
      "not know why she had come to her father-in-law's house; she herself did\n",

      "\n",
      "In the lighted room she saw the child sleeping, his fists clenched, his\n",
      "body wasted with fever. At sight of him, her heart became parched and\n",
      "thirsty. If only she could press that tortured body to her breast!\n",
      "Immediately the thought followed: \"I do not exist. Who would see it? His\n",

      "\n",
      "The child turned on his side, and cried, half-asleep: \"Auntie, give\n",
      "me water.\" Her darling had not yet forgotten his auntie! In a fever of\n",
      "excitement, she poured out some water, and, taking him to her breast,\n",
      "she gave it him.\n",
      "\n",
      "As long as he was asleep, the child felt no strangeness in taking water\n",
      "from the accustomed hand. But when Kadambini satisfied her long-starved\n",
      "longing, and kissed him and began rocking him asleep again, he awoke and\n",

      "of wood, unable to flee or speak. Seeing all this, the child, too,\n",
      "became terrified, and burst out weeping: \"Go away, Auntie,\" he said, \"go\n",
      "away!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now at last Kadambini understood that she had not died. The old room,\n",
      "the old things, the same child, the same love, all returned to their\n",
      "living state, without change or difference between her and them. In her\n",
      "friend's house she had felt that her childhood's companion was dead. In\n",
      "her child's room she knew that the boy's \"Auntie\" was not dead at all.\n",
      "In anguished tones she said: \"Sister, why do you dread me? See, I am as\n",

      "from behind the sacrificial fire. Alas! what is sport for the gods is\n",
      "not always a joke to us poor mortals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Purnendu Sekhar, the father of Nabendu, was a man well known amongst\n",
      "the English officials of the Government. In the voyage of life he had\n",
      "arrived at the desert shores of Rai Bahadurship by diligently plying his\n",
      "oats of salaams. He held in reserve enough for further advancement, but\n",
      "at the age of fifty-five, his tender gaze still fixed on the misty peals\n",
      "of Raja-hood, he suddenly found himself transported to a region where\n",
      "earthly honours and decorations are naught, and his salaam-wearied neck\n",
      "found everlasting repose on the funeral pyre.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to modern science, force is not destroyed, but is merely\n",
      "converted to another form, and applied to another point. So Purnendu's\n",
      "salaam-force, constant handmaid of the fickle Goddess of Fortune,\n",
      "descended from the shoulder of the father to that of his worthy son; and\n",
      "the youthful head of Nabendu Sekhar began to move up and down, at the\n",
      "doors of high-placed Englishmen, like a pumpkin swayed by the wind.\n",
      "\n",
      "The traditions of the family into which he had married were entirely\n",
      "different. Its eldest son, Pramathanath, had won for himself the love\n",
      "of his kinsfolk and the regard of all who knew him. His kinsmen and his\n",
      "neighbours looked up to him as their ideal in all things.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pramathanath was a Bachelor of Arts, and in addition was gifted with\n",
      "common sense. But he held no high official position; he had no handsome\n",
      "salary; nor did he exert any influence with his pen. There was no one in\n",
      "power to lend him a helping hand, because he desired to keep away\n",
      "from Englishmen, as much as they desired to keep away from him. So it\n",
      "happened that he shone only within the sphere of his family and his\n",
      "friends, and excited no admiration beyond it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet this Pramathanath had once sojourned in England for some three\n",
      "years. The kindly treatment he received during his stay there\n",
      "overpowered him so much that he forgot the sorrow and the humiliation of\n",
      "his own country, and came back dressed in European clothes. This rather\n",
      "grieved his brothers and his sisters at first, but after a few days they\n",
      "began to think that European clothes suited nobody better, and gradually\n",
      "they came to share his pride and dignity.\n",
      "\n",
      "On his return from England, Pramathanath resolved that he would show the\n",
      "world how to associate with Anglo-Indians on terms of equality. Those of\n",
      "our countrymen who think that no such association is possible, unless\n",
      "we bend our knees to them, showed their utter lack of self-respect, and\n",
      "were also unjust to the English-so thought Pramathanath.\n",
      "\n",
      "He brought with him letters of introduction from many distinguished\n",
      "Englishmen at home, and these gave him some recognition in Anglo-Indian\n",
      "society. He and his wife occasionally enjoyed English hospitality at\n",
      "tea, dinner, sports and other entertainments. Such good luck intoxicated\n",
      "him, and began to produce a tingling sensation in every vein of his\n",
      "body.\n",
      "\n",
      "About this time, at the opening of a new railway line, many of the\n",
      "town, proud recipients of official favour, were invited by the\n",
      "Lieutenant-Governor to take the first trip. Pramathanath was among them.\n",
      "On the return journey, a European Sergeant of the Police expelled\n",
      "some Indian gentlemen from a railway-carriage with great insolence.\n",
      "Pramathanath, dressed in his European clothes, was there. He, too, was\n",
      "getting out, when the Sergeant said: \"You needn't move, sir. Keep your\n",
      "seat, please.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At first Pramathanath felt flattered at the special respect thus shown\n",
      "to him. When, however, the train went on, the dull rays of the setting\n",
      "sun, at the west of the fields, now ploughed up and stripped of green,\n",
      "seemed in his eyes to spread a glow of shame over the whole country.\n",
      "Sitting near the window of his lonely compartment, he seemed to catch\n",
      "a glimpse of the down-cast eyes of his Motherland, hidden behind the\n",
      "trees. As Pramathanath sat there, lost in reverie, burning tears flowed\n",
      "down his cheeks, and his heart burst with indignation.\n",
      "\n",
      "He now remembered the story of a donkey who was drawing the chariot\n",
      "of an idol along the street. The wayfarers bowed down to the idol,\n",
      "and touched the dusty ground with their foreheads. The foolish donkey\n",
      "imagined that all this reverence was being shown to him. \"The only\n",
      "difference,\" said Pramathanath to himself, \"between the donkey and\n",
      "myself is this: I understand to-day that the respect I receive is not\n",
      "given to me but to the burden on my back.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Arriving home, Pramathanath called together all the children of the\n",
      "household, and lighting a big bonfire, threw all his European clothes\n",
      "into it one by one. The children danced round and round it, and the\n",
      "higher the flames shot up, the greater was their merriment. After that,\n",
      "Pramathanath gave up his sip of tea and bits of toast in Anglo-Indian\n",
      "houses, and once again sat inaccessible within the castle of his house,\n",
      "while his insulted friends went about from the door of one Englishman to\n",
      "that of another, bending their turbaned heads as before.\n",
      "\n",
      "By an irony of fate, poor Nabendu Sekhar married the second daughter of\n",
      "this house. His sisters-in-law were well educated and handsome. Nabendu\n",
      "considered he had made a lucky bargain. But he lost no time in trying to\n",
      "impress on the family that it was a rare bargain on their side also. As\n",
      "if by mistake, he would often hand to his sisters-in-law sundry letters\n",
      "that his late father had received from Europeans. And when the cherry\n",
      "lips of those young ladies smiled sarcastically, and the point of a\n",
      "shining dagger peeped out of its sheath of red velvet, the unfortunate\n",
      "man saw his folly, and regretted it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Labanyalekha, the eldest sister, surpassed the rest in beauty and\n",
      "cleverness. Finding an auspicious day, she put on the mantel-shelf of\n",
      "Nabendu's bedroom two pairs of English boots, daubed with vermilion, and\n",
      "arranged flowers, sandal-paste, incense and a couple of burning candles\n",
      "before them in true ceremonial fashion. When Nabendu came in, the\n",
      "two sisters-in-law stood on either side of him, and said with mock\n",
      "solemnity: \"Bow down to your gods, and may you prosper through their\n",
      "blessings.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The third sister Kiranlekha spent many days in embroidering with red\n",
      "silk one hundred common English names such as Jones, Smith, Brown,\n",
      "Thomson, etc., on a chadar. When it was ready, she presented this\n",
      "namavoli (A namavoli is a sheet of cloth printed all over with the names\n",
      "of Hindu gods and goddesses and worn by pious Hindus when engaged in\n",
      "devotional exercises.) to Nabendu Sekhar with great ceremony.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fourth, Sasankalekha, of tender age and therefore of no account,\n",
      "said: \"I will make you a string of beads, brother, with which to tell\n",
      "the names of your gods-the sahibs.\" Her sisters reproved her, saying:\n",
      "\"Run away, you saucy girl.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Feelings of shame and irritation assailed by turns the mind of Nabendu\n",
      "Sekhar. Still he could not forego the company of his sisters-in-law,\n",
      "especially as the eldest one was beautiful. Her honey was no less than\n",
      "her gall, and Nabendu's mind tasted at once the sweetness of the one\n",
      "and the bitterness of the other. The butterfly, with its bruised wings,\n",
      "buzzes round the flower in blind fury, unable to depart.\n",
      "\n",
      "The society of his sisters-in-Law so much infatuated him that at last\n",
      "Nabendu began to disavow his craving for European favours. When he\n",
      "went to salaam the Burra Sahib, he used to pretend that he was going\n",
      "to listen to a speech by Mr. Surendranath Banerjea. When he went to\n",
      "the railway station to pay respects to the Chota Sahib, returning\n",
      "from Darjeeling, he would tell his sisters-in-law that he expected his\n",
      "youngest uncle.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a sore trial to the unhappy man placed between the cross-fires of\n",
      "his Sahibs and his sisters-in-law. The sisters-in-law, however, secretly\n",
      "vowed that they would not rest till the Sahibs had been put to rout.\n",
      "\n",
      "About this time it was rumoured that Nabendu's name would be included\n",
      "in the forthcoming list of Birthday honours, and that he would mount the\n",
      "first step of the ladder to Paradise by becoming a Rai Bahadur. The\n",
      "poor fellow had not the courage to break the joyful news to his\n",
      "sisters-in-law. One evening, however, when the autumn moon was flooding\n",
      "the earth with its mischievous beams, Nabendu's heart was so full that\n",
      "he could not contain himself any longer, and he told his wife. The\n",
      "next day, Mrs. Nabendu betook herself to her eldest sister's house in a\n",
      "palanquin, and in a voice choked with tears bewailed her lot.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He isn't going to grow a tail,\" said Labanya, \"by becoming a Rai\n",
      "Bahadur, is he? Why should you feel so very humiliated?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no, sister dear,\" replied Arunlekha, \"I am prepared to be\n",
      "anything--but not a Rai-Baha-durni.\" The fact was that in her circle\n",
      "of acquaintances there was one Bhutnath Babu, who was a Rai Bahadur, and\n",
      "that explained her intense aversion to that title.\n",
      "\n",
      "Labanya said to her sister in soothing tones: \"Don't be upset about it,\n",
      "dear; I will see what I can do to prevent it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Babu Nilratan, the husband of Labanya, was a pleader at Buxar. When the\n",
      "autumn was over, Nabendu received an invitation from Labanya to pay them\n",
      "a visit, and he started for Buxar greatly pleased.\n",
      "\n",
      "The early winter of the western province endowed Labanyalekha with new\n",
      "health and beauty, and brought a glowing colour to her pale cheeks, She\n",
      "looked like the flower-laden kasa reeds on a clear autumn day, growing\n",
      "by the lonely bank of a rivulet. To Nabendu's enchanted eyes she\n",
      "appeared like a malati plant in full blossom, showering dew-drops\n",
      "brilliant with the morning light.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nabendu had never felt better in his life. The exhilaration of his own\n",
      "health and the genial company of his pretty sister-in-law made him think\n",
      "himself light enough to tread on air. The Ganges in front of the garden\n",
      "seemed to him to be flowing ceaselessly to regions unknown, as though it\n",
      "gave shape to his own wild fantasies.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he returned in the early morning from his walk on the bank of the\n",
      "river, the mellow rays of the winter sun gave his whole frame that\n",
      "pleasing sensation of warmth which lovers feel in each other's arms.\n",
      "Coming home, he would now and then find his sister-in-Law amusing\n",
      "herself by cooking some dishes. He would offer his help, and display his\n",
      "want of skill and ignorance at every step. But Nabendu did not appear to\n",
      "be at all anxious to improve himself by practice and attention. On\n",
      "the contrary he thoroughly enjoyed the rebukes he received from his\n",
      "sister-in-law. He was at great pains to prove every day that he was\n",
      "inefficient and helpless as a new-born babe in mixing spices, handling\n",
      "the saucepan, and regulating the heat so as to prevent things getting\n",
      "burnt-and he was duly rewarded with pitiful smiles and scoldings.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the middle of the day he ate a great deal of the good food set before\n",
      "him, incited by his keen appetite and the coaxing of his sister-in-law.\n",
      "Later on, he would sit down to a game of cards--at which he betrayed\n",
      "the same lack of ability. He would cheat, pry into his adversary's hand,\n",
      "quarrel--but never did he win a single rubber, and worse still, he would\n",
      "not acknowledge defeat. This brought him abuse every day, and still he\n",
      "remained incorrigible.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was, however, one matter in which his reform was complete. For the\n",
      "time at least, he had forgotten that to win the smiles of Sahibs was the\n",
      "final goal of life. He was beginning to understand how happy and worthy\n",
      "we might feel by winning the affection and esteem of those near and dear\n",
      "to us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides, Nabendu was now moving in a new atmosphere. Labanya's husband,\n",
      "Babu Nilratan, a leader of the bar, was reproached by many because\n",
      "he refused to pay his respects to European officials. To all such\n",
      "reproaches Nilratan would reply: \"No, thank you,--if they are not polite\n",
      "enough to return my call, then the politeness I offer them is a loss\n",
      "that can never be made up for. The sands of the desert may be very white\n",
      "and shiny, but I would much rather sow my seeds in black soil, where I\n",
      "can expect a return.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And Nabendu began to adopt similar ideas, all regardless of the future.\n",
      "His chance of Rai Bahadurship throve on the soil carefully prepared by\n",
      "his late father and also by himself in days gone by, nor was any fresh\n",
      "watering required. Had he not at great expense laid out a splendid\n",
      "race-course in a town, which was a fashionable resort of Europeans?\n",
      "\n",
      "When the time of Congress drew near, Nilratan received a request from\n",
      "head-quarters to collect subscriptions. Nabendu, free from anxiety,\n",
      "was merrily engaged in a game of cards with his sister-in-law, when\n",
      "Nilratan Babu came upon him with a subscription-book in his hand, and\n",
      "said: \"Your signature, please.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "From old habit Nabendu looked horrified. Labanya, assuming an air of\n",
      "great concern and anxiety, said: \"Never do that. It would ruin your\n",
      "racecourse beyond repair.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Nabendu blurted out: \"Do you suppose I pass sleepless nights through\n",
      "fear of that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We won't publish your name in the papers,\" said Nilratan reassuringly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Labanya, looking grave and anxious, said: \"Still, it wouldn't be safe.\n",
      "Things spread so, from mouth to mouth--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Nabendu replied with vehemence: \"My name wouldn't suffer by appearing\n",
      "in the newspapers.\" So saying, he snatched the subscription list from\n",
      "Nilratan's hand, and signed away a thousand rupees. Secretly he hoped\n",
      "that the papers would not publish the news.\n",
      "\n",
      "Labanya struck her forehead with her palm and gasped out: \"What--have\n",
      "you--done?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing wrong,\" said Nabendu boastfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But--but--,\" drawled Labanya, \"the Guard sahib of Sealdah Station,\n",
      "the shop-assistant at Whiteaway's, the syce-sahib of Hart Bros.--these\n",
      "gentlemen might be angry with you, and decline to come to your Poojah\n",
      "dinner to drink your champagne, you know. Just think, they mightn't pat\n",
      "you on the back, when you meet them again!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It wouldn't break my heart,\" Nabendu snapped out.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few days passed. One morning Nabendu was sipping his tea, and glancing\n",
      "at a newspaper. Suddenly a letter signed \"X\" caught his eye. The writer\n",
      "thanked him profusely for his donation, and declared that the increase\n",
      "of strength the Congress had acquired by having such a man within its\n",
      "fold, was inestimable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alas, father Purnendu Sekhar! Was it to increase the strength of the\n",
      "Congress, that you brought this wretch into the world?\n",
      "\n",
      "Put the cloud of misfortune had its silver lining. That he was not a\n",
      "mere cypher was clear from the fact that the Anglo-Indian community on\n",
      "the one side and the Congress on the other were each waiting patiently,\n",
      "eager to hook him, and land him on their own side. So Nabendu, beaming\n",
      "with pleasure took the paper to his sister-in-law, and showed her the\n",
      "letter. Looking as though she knew nothing about it, Labanya exclaimed\n",
      "in surprise: \"Oh, what a pity! Everything has come out! Who bore you\n",
      "such ill-will? Oh, how cruel of him, how wicked of him!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Nabendu laughed out, saying: \"Now--now--don't call him names, Labanya. I\n",
      "forgive him with all my heart, and bless him too.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A couple of days after this, an anti-Congress Anglo-Indian paper reached\n",
      "Nabendu through the post. There was a letter in it, signed \"One who\n",
      "knows,\" and contradicting the above report. \"Those who have the pleasure\n",
      "of Babu Nabendu Sekhar's personal acquaintance,\" the writer went on,\n",
      "\"cannot for a moment believe this absurd libel to be true. For him to\n",
      "turn a Congresswalla is as impossible as it is for the leopard to change\n",
      "his spots. He is a man of genuine worth, and neither a disappointed\n",
      "candidate for Government employ nor a briefless barrister. He is not one\n",
      "of those who, after a brief sojourn in England, return aping our dress\n",
      "and manners, audaciously try to thrust themselves on Anglo-Indian\n",
      "society, and finally go back in dejection. So there is absolutely no\n",
      "reason why Balm Nabendu Sekhar,\" etc., etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah, father Purnendu Sekhar! What a reputation you had made with the\n",

      "This letter also was paraded before his sister-in-law, for did it not\n",
      "assert that he was no mean, contemptible scallywag, but a man of real\n",
      "worth?\n",
      "\n",
      "Labanya exclaimed again in feigned surprise: \"Which of your friends\n",
      "wrote it now? Oh, come--is it the Ticket Collector, or the hide\n",
      "merchant, or is it the drum-major of the Fort?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You ought to send in a contradiction, I think,\" said Nilratan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it necessary?\" said Nabendu loftily. \"Must I contradict every little\n",
      "thing they choose to say against me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Labanya filled the room with a deluge of laughter. Nabendu felt a little\n",
      "disconcerted at this, and said: \"Why? What's the matter?\" She went on\n",
      "laughing, unable to check herself, and her youthful slender form waved\n",
      "to and fro. This torrent of merriment had the effect of overthrowing\n",
      "Nabendu completely, and he said in pitiable accents: \"Do you imagine\n",
      "that I am afraid to contradict it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, dear, no,\" said Labanya; \"I was thinking that you haven't yet\n",
      "ceased trying to save that race-course of yours, so full of promise.\n",
      "While there is life, there is hope, you know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's what I am afraid of, you think, do you? Very well, you shall\n",
      "see,\" said Nabendu desperately, and forthwith sat down to write his\n",
      "contradiction. When he had finished, Labanya and Nilratan read it\n",
      "through, and said: \"It isn't strong enough. We must give it them pretty\n",
      "hot, mustn't we?\" And they kindly undertook to revise the composition.\n",
      "Thus it ran: \"When one connected to us by ties of blood turns our enemy\n",
      "he becomes far more dangerous than any outsider. To the Government of\n",
      "India, the haughty Anglo-Indians are worse enemies than the Russians\n",
      "or the frontier Pathans themselves--they are the impenetrable barrier,\n",
      "forever hindering the growth of any bond of friendship between the\n",
      "Government and people of the country. It is the Congress which has\n",
      "opened up the royal road to a better understanding between the rulers\n",
      "and the ruled, and the Anglo-Indian papers have planted themselves like\n",
      "thorns across the whole breadth of that road,\" etc., etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nabendu had an inward fear as to the mischief this letter might do, but\n",
      "at the same time he felt elated at the excellence of its composition,\n",
      "which he fondly imagined to be his own. It was duly published, and\n",
      "for some days comments, replies, and rejoinders went on in various\n",
      "newspapers, and the air was full of trumpet-notes, proclaiming the\n",
      "fact that Nabendu had joined the Congress, and the amount of his\n",
      "subscription.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nabendu, now grown desperate, talked as though he was a patriot of\n",
      "the fiercest type. Labanya laughed inwardly, and said to herself:\n",
      "\"Well---well--you have to pass through the ordeal of fire yet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "One morning when Nabendu, before his bath, had finished rubbing oil\n",
      "over his chest, and was trying various devices to reach the inaccessible\n",
      "portions of his back, the bearer brought in a card inscribed with the\n",
      "name of the District Magistrate himself! Good heavens!--What would he\n",
      "do? He could not possibly go, and receive the Magistrate Sahib, thus\n",
      "oil-besmeared. He shook and twitched like a koi-fish, ready dressed for\n",
      "the frying pan. He finished his bath in a great hurry, tugged on his\n",
      "clothes somehow, and ran breathlessly to the outer apartments. The\n",
      "bearer said that the Sahib had just left after waiting for a long time.\n",
      "How much of the blame for concocting this drama of invented incidents\n",
      "may be set down to Labanya, and how much to the bearer is a nice problem\n",
      "for ethical mathematics to solve.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nabendu's heart was convulsed with pain within his breast, like the tail\n",
      "of a lizard just cut off. He moped like an owl all day long.\n",
      "\n",
      "Labanya banished all traces of inward merriment from her face, and kept\n",
      "on enquiring in anxious tones: \"What has happened to you? You are not\n",
      "ill, I hope?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Nabendu made great efforts to smile, and find a humorous reply. \"How\n",
      "can there be,\" he managed to say, \"any illness within your jurisdiction,\n",
      "since you yourself are the Goddess of Health?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But the smile soon flickered out. His thoughts were: \"I subscribed\n",
      "to the Congress fund to begin with, published a nasty letter in a\n",
      "newspaper, and on the top of that, when the Magistrate Sahib himself\n",
      "did me the honour to call on me, I kept him waiting. I wonder what he is\n",
      "thinking of me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Alas, father Purnendu Sekhar, by an irony of Fate I am made to appear\n",
      "what I am not.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning, Nabendu decked himself in his best clothes, wore his\n",
      "watch and chain, and put a big turban on his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where are you off to?\" enquired his sister-in-law.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Urgent business,\" Nabendu replied. Labanya kept quiet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arriving at the Magistrate's gate, he took out his card-case.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You cannot see him now,\" said the orderly peon icily.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nabendu took out a couple of rupees from his pocket. The peon at once\n",
      "salaamed him and said: \"There are five of us, sir.\" Immediately Nabendu\n",
      "pulled out a ten-rupee note, and handed it to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was sent for by the Magistrate, who was writing in his dressing-gown\n",
      "and bedroom slippers. Nabendu salaamed him. The Magistrate pointed to\n",
      "a chair with his finger, and without raising his eyes from the paper\n",
      "before him said: \"What can I do for you, Babu?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Fingering his watch-chain nervously, Nabendu said is shaky tones:\n",
      "\"Yesterday you were good enough to call at my place, sir--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Sahib knitted his brows, and, lifting just one eye from his paper,\n",
      "said: \"I called at your place! Babu, what nonsense are you talking?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Beg your pardon, sir,\" faltered out Nabendu. \"There has been a\n",
      "mistake--some confusion,\" and wet with perspiration, he tumbled out\n",
      "of the room somehow. And that night, as he lay tossing on his bed, a\n",
      "distant dream-like voice came into his ear with a recurring persistency:\n",
      "\"Babu, you are a howling idiot.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On his way home, Nabendu came to the conclusion that the Magistrate\n",
      "denied having called, simply because he was highly offended.\n",
      "\n",
      "So he explained to Labanya that he had been out purchasing rose-water.\n",
      "No sooner had he uttered the words than half-a-dozen chuprassis wearing\n",
      "the Collectorate badge made their appearance, and after salaaming\n",
      "Nabendu, stood there grinning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have they come to arrest you because you subscribed to the Congress\n",
      "fund?\" whispered Labanya with a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "The six peons displayed a dozen rows of teeth and said:\n",
      "\"Bakshish--Babu-Sahib.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "From a side room Nilratan came out, and said in an irritated manner:\n",
      "\"Bakshish? What for?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The peons, grinning as before, answered: \"The Babu-Sahib went to see the\n",
      "Magistrate--so we have come for bakshish.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't know,\" laughed out Labanya, \"that the Magistrate was selling\n",
      "rose-water nowadays. Coolness wasn't the special feature of his trade\n",
      "before.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Nabendu in trying to reconcile the story of his purchase with his visit\n",
      "to the Magistrate, uttered some incoherent words, which nobody could\n",
      "make sense of.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nilratan spoke to the peons: \"There has been no occasion for bakshish;\n",
      "you shan't have it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Nabendu said, feeling very small: \"Oh, they are poor men--what's\n",
      "the harm of giving them something?\" And he took out a currency note.\n",
      "Nilratan snatched it way from Nabendu's hand, remarking: \"There are\n",
      "poorer men in the world--I will give it to them for you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Nabendu felt greatly distressed that he was not able to appease these\n",
      "ghostly retainers of the angry Siva. When the peons were leaving, with\n",
      "thunder in their eyes, he looked at them languishingly, as much as to\n",
      "say: \"You know everything, gentlemen, it is not my fault.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Congress was to be held at Calcutta this year. Nilratan went down\n",

      "\n",
      "As soon as they arrived at Calcutta, the Congress party surrounded\n",
      "Nabendu, and their delight and enthusiasm knew no bounds. They cheered\n",
      "him, honoured him, and extolled him up to the skies. Everybody said\n",
      "that, unless leading men like Nabendu devoted themselves to the Cause,\n",
      "there was no hope for the country. Nabendu was disposed to agree with\n",
      "them, and emerged out of the chaos of mistake and confusion as a leader\n",
      "of the country. When he entered the Congress Pavilion on the first day,\n",
      "everybody stood up, and shouted \"Hip, hip, hurrah,\" in a loud outlandish\n",
      "voice, hearing which our Motherland reddened with shame to the root of\n",
      "her ears.\n",
      "\n",
      "In due time the Queen's birthday came, and Nabendu's name was not found\n",
      "in the list of Rai Bahadurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "He received an invitation from Labanya for that evening. When he arrived\n",
      "there, Labanya with great pomp and ceremony presented him with a robe\n",
      "of honour, and with her own hand put a mark of red sandal paste on the\n",
      "middle of his forehead. Each of the other sisters threw round his neck a\n",
      "garland of flowers woven by herself. Decked in a pink Sari and dazzling\n",
      "jewels, his wife Arunlekha was waiting in a side room, her face lit up\n",
      "with smiles and blushes. Her sisters rushed to her, and, placing another\n",
      "garland in her hand, insisted that she also should come, and do her\n",
      "part in the ceremony, but she would not listen to it; and that principal\n",
      "garland, cherishing a desire for Nabendu's neck, waited patiently for\n",
      "the still secrecy of midnight.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sisters said to Nabendu: \"To-day we crown thee King. Such honour\n",
      "will not be done to any body else in Hindoostan.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether Nabendu derived any consolation from this, he alone can tell;\n",
      "but we greatly doubt it. We believe, in fact, that he will become a\n",
      "Rai Bahadur before he has done, and the Englishman and the Pioneer will\n",
      "write heart-rending articles lamenting his demise at the proper time.\n",
      "So, in the meanwhile, Three Cheers for Babu Purnendu Sekhar! Hip, hip,\n",

      "I\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a night of full moon early in the month of Phalgun. The youthful\n",
      "spring was everywhere sending forth its breeze laden with the fragrance\n",
      "of mango-blossoms. The melodious notes of an untiring papiya (One of the\n",
      "sweetest songsters in Bengal. Anglo-Indian writers have nicknamed it the\n",
      "\"brain-fever bird,\" which is a sheer libel.), concealed within the\n",
      "thick foliage of an old lichi tree by the side of a tank, penetrated a\n",
      "sleepless bedroom of the Mukerji family. There Hemanta now restlessly\n",
      "twisted a lock of his wife's hair round his finger, now beat her churl\n",
      "against her wristlet until it tinkled, now pulled at the chaplet of\n",
      "flowers about her head, and left it hanging over hex face. His mood\n",
      "was that of as evening breeze which played about a favourite flowering\n",
      "shrub, gently shaking her now this side, now that, in the hope of\n",
      "rousing her to animation.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Kusum sat motionless, looking out of the open window, with eyes\n",
      "immersed in the moonlit depth of never-ending space beyond. Her\n",
      "husband's caresses were lost on her.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last Hemanta clasped both the hands of his wife, and, shaking them\n",
      "gently, said: \"Kusum, where are you? A patient search through a big\n",
      "telescope would reveal you only as a small speck-you seem to have\n",
      "receded so far away. O, do come closer to me, dear. See how beautiful\n",
      "the night is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kusum turned her eyes from the void of space towards her husband, and\n",
      "said slowly: \"I know a mantra (A set of magic words.), which could in\n",
      "one moment shatter this spring night and the moon into pieces.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you do,\" laughed Hemanta, \"pray don't utter it. If any mantra of\n",
      "yours could bring three or four Saturdays during the week, and prolong\n",
      "the nights till 5 P.M. the next day, say it by all means.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Saying this, he tried to draw his wife a little closer to him. Kusum,\n",
      "freeing herself from the embrace, said: \"Do you know, to-night I feel\n",
      "a longing to tell you what I promised to reveal only on my death-bed.\n",
      "To-night I feel that I could endure whatever punishment you might\n",
      "inflict on me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hemanta was on the point of making a jest about punishments by reciting\n",
      "a verse from Jayadeva, when the sound of an angry pair of slippers\n",
      "was heard approaching rapidly. They were the familiar footsteps of his\n",
      "father, Haribar Mukerji, and Hemanta, not knowing what it meant, was in\n",
      "a flutter of excitement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Standing outside the door Harihar roared out: \"Hemanta, turn your wife\n",
      "out of the house immediately.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hemanta looked at his wife, and detected no trace of surprise in her\n",
      "features. She merely buried her face within the palms of her hands, and,\n",
      "with all the strength and intensity of her soul, wished that she could\n",
      "then and there melt into nothingness. It was the same papiya whose\n",
      "song floated into the room with the south breeze, and no one heard it.\n",
      "Endless are the beauties of the earth-but alas, how easily everything is\n",
      "twisted out of shape.\n",
      "\n",
      "II\n",
      "\n",
      "Returning from without, Hemanta asked his wife: \"Is it true?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is,\" replied Kusum.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why didn't you tell me long ago?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did try many a time, and I always failed. I am a wretched woman.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then tell me everything now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kusum gravely told her story in a firm unshaken voice. She waded\n",
      "barefooted through fire, as it were, with slow unflinching steps, and\n",
      "nobody knew how much she was scorched. Having heard her to the end,\n",
      "Hemanta rose and walked out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kusum thought that her husband had gone, never to return to her again.\n",
      "It did not strike her as strange. She took it as naturally as any other\n",
      "incident of everyday life-so dry and apathetic had her mind become\n",
      "during the last few moments. Only the world and love seemed to her as\n",
      "a void and make-believe from beginning to end. Even the memory of the\n",
      "protestations of love, which her husband had made to her in days past,\n",
      "brought to her lips a dry, hard, joyless smile, like a sharp cruel knife\n",
      "which had cut through her heart. She was thinking, perhaps, that the\n",
      "love which seemed to fill so much of one's life, which brought in its\n",
      "train such fondness and depth of feeling, which made even the briefest\n",
      "separation so exquisitely painful and a moment's union so intensely\n",
      "sweet, which seemed boundless in its extent and eternal in its\n",
      "duration, the cessation of which could not be imagined even in births to\n",
      "come--that this was that love! So feeble was its support! No sooner does\n",
      "the priesthood touch it than your \"eternal\" love crumbles into a handful\n",
      "of dust! Only a short while ago Hemanta had whispered to her: \"What a\n",
      "beautiful night!\" The same night was not yet at an end, the same yapiya\n",
      "was still warbling, the same south breeze still blew into the roam,\n",
      "making the bed-curtain shiver; the same moonlight lay on the bed next\n",
      "the open window, sleeping like a beautiful heroine exhausted with\n",
      "gaiety. All this was unreal! Love was more falsely dissembling than she\n",
      "herself!\n",
      "\n",
      "III\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning Hemanta, fagged after a sleepless night, and looking\n",
      "like one distracted, called at the house of Peari Sankar Ghosal. \"What\n",
      "news, my son?\" Peari Sankar greeted him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hemanta, flaring up like a big fire, said in a trembling voice: \"You\n",
      "have defiled our caste. You have brought destruction upon us. And you\n",
      "will have to pay for it.\" He could say no more; he felt choked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And you have preserved my caste, presented my ostracism from the\n",
      "community, and patted me on the back affectionately!\" said Peari Sankar\n",
      "with a slight sarcastic smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hemanta wished that his Brahmin-fury could reduce Peari Sankar to ashes\n",
      "in a moment, but his rage burnt only himself. Peari Sankar sat before\n",
      "him unscathed, and in the best of health.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did I ever do you any harm?\" demanded Hemanta in a broken voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let me ask you one question,\" said Peari Sankar. \"My daughter--my only\n",
      "child-what harm had she done your father? You were very young then,\n",
      "and probably never heard. Listen, then. Now, don't you excite yourself.\n",
      "There is much humour in what I am going to relate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You were quite small when my son-in-law Nabakanta ran away to England\n",
      "after stealing my daughter's jewels. You might truly remember the\n",
      "commotion in the village when he returned as a barrister five years\n",
      "later. Or, perhaps, you were unaware of it, as you were at school in\n",
      "Calcutta at the time. Your father, arrogating to himself the headship\n",
      "of the community, declared that if I sent my daughter to her husband's\n",
      "home, I must renounce her for good, and never again allow her to cross\n",
      "my threshold. I fell at your father's feet, and implored him, saying:\n",
      "'Brother, save me this once. I will make the boy swallow cow-dung, and\n",
      "go through the prayaschittam ceremony. Do take him back into caste.' But\n",
      "your father remained obdurate. For my part, I could not disown my only\n",
      "child, and, bidding good-bye to my village and my kinsmen, I betook\n",
      "myself to Calcutta. There, too, my troubles followed me. When I had made\n",
      "every arrangement for my nephew's marriage, your father stirred up the\n",
      "girl's people, and they broke the match off. Then I took a solemn vow\n",
      "that, if there was a drop of Brahmin blood flowing in my veins, I would\n",
      "avenge myself. You understand the business to some extent now, don't\n",
      "you? But wait a little longer. You will enjoy it, when I tell you the\n",
      "whole story; it is interesting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When you were attending college, one Bipradas Chatterji used to live\n",
      "next door to your lodgings. The poor fellow is dead now. In his house\n",
      "lived a child-widow called Kusum, the destitute orphan of a Kayestha\n",
      "gentleman. The girl was very pretty, and the old Brahmin desired to\n",
      "shield her from the hungry gaze of college students. But for a young\n",
      "girl to throw dust in the eyes of her old guardian was not at all a\n",
      "difficult task. She often went to the top of the roof, to hang her\n",
      "washing out to dry, and, I believe, you found your own roof best suited\n",
      "for your studies. Whether you two spoke to each other, when on your\n",
      "respective roofs, I cannot tell, but the girl's behaviour excited\n",
      "suspicion in the old man's mind. She made frequent mistakes in her\n",
      "household duties, and, like Parbati (The wife of Shiva the Destroyer),\n",
      "engaged in her devotions, began gradually to renounce food and sleep.\n",
      "Some evenings she would burst into tears in the presence of the old\n",

      "\"So he went. I lodged the girl in the house of Sripati Chatterji,\n",
      "passing him off as her father. What happened next is known to you.\n",
      "I feel a great relief to-day, having told you everything from the\n",
      "beginning. It sounds like a romance, doesn't it? I think of turning it\n",
      "into a book, and getting it printed. But I am not a writing-man myself.\n",
      "They say my nephew has some aptitude that way--I will get him to write\n",
      "it for me. But the best thing would be, if you would collaborate with\n",
      "him, because the conclusion of the story is not known to me so well.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Without paying much attention to the concluding remarks of Peari Sankar,\n",
      "Hemanta asked: \"Did not Kusum object to this marriage?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Peari Sankar, \"it is very difficult to guess. You know, my\n",
      "boy, how women's minds are constituted. When they say 'no,' they mean\n",
      "'yes.' During the first few days after her removal to the new home, she\n",
      "went almost crazy at not seeing you. You, too, seemed to have discovered\n",
      "her new address somehow, as you used to lose your way after starting for\n",
      "college, and loiter about in front of Sripati's house. Your eyes did not\n",
      "appear to be exactly in search of the Presidency College, as they were\n",
      "directed towards the barred windows of a private house, through which\n",
      "nothing but insects and the hearts of moon-struck young men could obtain\n",
      "access. I felt very sorry for you both. I could see that your studies\n",
      "were being seriously interrupted, and that the plight of the girl was\n",
      "pitiable also.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One day I called Kusum to me, and said: 'Listen to me, my daughter. I\n",
      "am an old man, and you need feel no delicacy in my presence. I know whom\n",
      "you desire at heart. The young man's condition is hopeless too. I wish I\n",
      "could bring about your union.' At this Kusum suddenly melted into tears,\n",
      "and ran away. On several evenings after that, I visited Sripati's house,\n",
      "and, calling Kusum to me, discussed with her matters relating to you,\n",
      "and so I succeeded in gradually overcoming her shyness. At last, when I\n",
      "said that I would try to bring about a marriage, she asked me: 'How\n",
      "can it be?' 'Never mind,' I said, 'I would pass you off as a Brahmin\n",
      "maiden.' After a good deal of argument, she begged me to find out\n",
      "whether you would approve of it. 'What nonsense,' replied I, 'the boy\n",
      "is well-nigh mad as it were, what's the use of disclosing all these\n",
      "complications to him? Let the ceremony be over smoothly and then--all's\n",
      "well that ends well. Especially, as there is not the slightest risk of\n",
      "its ever leaking out, why go out of the way to make a fellow miserable\n",
      "for life?'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not know whether the plan had Kusum's assent or not. At times she\n",
      "wept, and at other times she remained silent. If I said, 'Let us drop it\n",
      "then,' she would become very restless. When things were in this state, I\n",
      "sent Sripati to you with the proposal of marriage; you consented without\n",
      "a moment's hesitation. Everything was settled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shortly before the day fixed, Kusum became so obstinate that I had\n",
      "the greatest difficulty in bringing her round again. 'Do let it drop,\n",
      "uncle,' she said to me constantly. 'What do you mean, you silly child,'\n",
      "I rebuked her,' how can we back out now, when everything has been\n",
      "settled?'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Spread a rumour that I am dead,' she implored. 'Send me away\n",
      "somewhere.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'What would happen to the young man then?' said I.' He is now in the\n",
      "seventh heaven of delight, expecting that his long cherished desire\n",
      "would be fulfilled to-morrow; and to-day you want me to send him the\n",
      "news of your death. The result would be that to-morrow I should have to\n",
      "bear the news of his death to you, and the same evening your death\n",
      "would be reported to me. Do you imagine, child, that I am capable of\n",
      "committing a girl-murder and a Brahmin-murder at my age?'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Eventually the happy marriage was celebrated at the auspicious moment,\n",
      "and I felt relieved of a burdensome duty which I owed to myself. What\n",
      "happened afterwards you know best.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Couldn't you stop after having done us an irreparable injury?\" burst\n",
      "out Hemanta after a short silence. \"Why have you told the secret now?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With the utmost composure, Peari Sankar replied: \"When I saw that all\n",
      "arrangements had been made for the wedding of your sister, I said to\n",
      "myself: 'Well, I have fouled the caste of one Brahmin, but that was only\n",
      "from a sense of duty. Here, another Brahmin's caste is imperilled, and\n",
      "this time it is my plain duty to prevent it.' So I wrote to them saying\n",
      "that I was in a position to prove that you had taken the daughter of a\n",
      "sudra to wife.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Controlling himself with a gigantic effort, Hemanta said: \"What will\n",

      "and shelter?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have done what was mine to do,\" replied Peari Sankar calmly. \"It is\n",
      "no part of my duty to look after the discarded wives of other people.\n",

      "it. And some pan too.\"\n",

      "It was the fifth night of the waning of the moon--and the night was\n",
      "dark. No birds were singing. The lichi tree by the tank looked like\n",
      "a smudge of ink on a background a shade less deep. The south wind was\n",
      "blindly roaming about in the darkness like a sleep-walker. The stars\n",
      "in the sky with vigilant unblinking eyes were trying to penetrate the\n",
      "darkness, in their effort to fathom some profound mystery.\n",
      "\n",
      "No light shone in the bedroom. Hemanta was sitting on the side of the\n",
      "bed next the open window, gazing at the darkness in front of him. Kusum\n",
      "lay on the floor, clasping her husband's feet with both her arms,\n",
      "and her face resting on them. Time stood like an ocean hushed into\n",
      "stillness. On the background of eternal night, Fate seemed to have\n",
      "painted this one single picture for all time--annihilation on every\n",
      "side, the judge in the centre of it, and the guilty one at his feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sound of slippers was heard again. Approaching the door, Harihar\n",

      "the girl out of the house.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kusum, as she heard this, embraced her husband's feet with all the\n",

      "forehead to them reverentially, withdrew herself.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My five years' old daughter Mini cannot live without chattering. I\n",
      "really believe that in all her life she has not wasted a minute in\n",
      "silence. Her mother is often vexed at this, and would stop her prattle,\n",
      "but I would not. To see Mini quiet is unnatural, and I cannot bear it\n",
      "long. And so my own talk with her is always lively.\n",
      "\n",
      "One morning, for instance, when I was in the midst of the seventeenth\n",
      "chapter of my new novel, my little Mini stole into the room, and putting\n",
      "her hand into mine, said: \"Father! Ramdayal the door-keeper calls a crow\n",
      "a krow! He doesn't know anything, does he?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Before I could explain to her the differences of language in this world,\n",
      "she was embarked on the full tide of another subject. \"What do you\n",
      "think, Father? Bhola says there is an elephant in the clouds, blowing\n",
      "water out of his trunk, and that is why it rains!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And then, darting off anew, while I sat still making ready some reply to\n",
      "this last saying, \"Father! what relation is Mother to you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear little sister in the law!\" I murmured involuntarily to myself,\n",
      "but with a grave face contrived to answer: \"Go and play with Bhola,\n",
      "Mini! I am busy!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The window of my room overlooks the road. The child had seated herself\n",
      "at my feet near my table, and was playing softly, drumming on her knees.\n",
      "I was hard at work on my seventeenth chapter, where Protrap Singh, the\n",
      "hero, had just caught Kanchanlata, the heroine, in his arms, and was\n",
      "about to escape with her by the third story window of the castle, when\n",
      "all of a sudden Mini left her play, and ran to the window, crying, \"A\n",
      "Cabuliwallah! a Cabuliwallah!\" Sure enough in the street below was a\n",
      "Cabuliwallah, passing slowly along. He wore the loose soiled clothing\n",
      "of his people, with a tall turban; there was a bag on his back, and he\n",
      "carried boxes of grapes in his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot tell what were my daughter's feelings at the sight of this man,\n",
      "but she began to call him loudly. \"Ah!\" I thought, \"he will come in, and\n",
      "my seventeenth chapter will never be finished!\" At which exact moment\n",
      "the Cabuliwallah turned, and looked up at the child. When she saw\n",
      "this, overcome by terror, she fled to her mother's protection, and\n",
      "disappeared. She had a blind belief that inside the bag, which the\n",
      "big man carried, there were perhaps two or three other children like\n",
      "herself. The pedlar meanwhile entered my doorway, and greeted me with a\n",
      "smiling face.\n",
      "\n",
      "So precarious was the position of my hero and my heroine, that my first\n",
      "impulse was to stop and buy something, since the man had been called. I\n",
      "made some small purchases, and a conversation began about Abdurrahman,\n",
      "the Russians, she English, and the Frontier Policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he was about to leave, he asked: \"And where is the little girl, sir?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And I, thinking that Mini must get rid of her false fear, had her\n",
      "brought out.\n",
      "\n",
      "She stood by my chair, and looked at the Cabuliwallah and his bag. He\n",
      "offered her nuts and raisins, but she would not be tempted, and only\n",
      "clung the closer to me, with all her doubts increased.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was their first meeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "One morning, however, not many days later, as I was leaving the house, I\n",
      "was startled to find Mini, seated on a bench near the door, laughing and\n",
      "talking, with the great Cabuliwallah at her feet. In all her life, it\n",
      "appeared; my small daughter had never found so patient a listener, save\n",
      "her father. And already the corner of her little sari was stuffed with\n",
      "almonds and raisins, the gift of her visitor, \"Why did you give her\n",
      "those?\" I said, and taking out an eight-anna bit, I handed it to him.\n",
      "The man accepted the money without demur, and slipped it into his\n",
      "pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alas, on my return an hour later, I found the unfortunate coin had made\n",
      "twice its own worth of trouble! For the Cabuliwallah had given it to\n",
      "Mini, and her mother catching sight of the bright round object, had\n",
      "pounced on the child with: \"Where did you get that eight-anna bit?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Cabuliwallah gave it me,\" said Mini cheerfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Cabuliwallah gave it you!\" cried her mother much shocked. \"Oh,\n",
      "Mini! how could you take it from him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I, entering at the moment, saved her from impending disaster, and\n",
      "proceeded to make my own inquiries.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not the first or second time, I found, that the two had met.\n",
      "The Cabuliwallah had overcome the child's first terror by a judicious\n",
      "bribery of nuts and almonds, and the two were now great friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had many quaint jokes, which afforded them much amusement. Seated\n",
      "in front of him, looking down on his gigantic frame in all her tiny\n",
      "dignity, Mini would ripple her face with laughter, and begin: \"O\n",
      "Cabuliwallah, Cabuliwallah, what have you got in your bag?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And he would reply, in the nasal accents of the mountaineer: \"An\n",
      "elephant!\" Not much cause for merriment, perhaps; but how they both\n",
      "enjoyed the witticism! And for me, this child's talk with a grown-up man\n",
      "had always in it something strangely fascinating.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Cabuliwallah, not to be behindhand, would take his turn: \"Well,\n",
      "little one, and when are you going to the father-in-law's house?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now most small Bengali maidens have heard long ago about the\n",
      "father-in-law's house; but we, being a little new-fangled, had kept\n",
      "these things from our child, and Mini at this question must have been\n",
      "a trifle bewildered. But she would not show it, and with ready tact\n",
      "replied: \"Are you going there?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Amongst men of the Cabuliwallah's class, however, it is well known that\n",
      "the words father-in-law's house have a double meaning. It is a euphemism\n",
      "for jail, the place where we are well cared for, at no expense to\n",
      "ourselves. In this sense would the sturdy pedlar take my daughter's\n",
      "question. \"Ah,\" he would say, shaking his fist at an invisible\n",
      "policeman, \"I will thrash my father-in-law!\" Hearing this, and picturing\n",
      "the poor discomfited relative, Mini would go off into peals of laughter,\n",
      "in which her formidable friend would join.\n",
      "\n",
      "These were autumn mornings, the very time of year when kings of old\n",
      "went forth to conquest; and I, never stirring from my little corner in\n",
      "Calcutta, would let my mind wander over the whole world. At the very\n",
      "name of another country, my heart would go out to it, and at the sight\n",
      "of a foreigner in the streets, I would fall to weaving a network of\n",
      "dreams,--the mountains, the glens, and the forests of his distant home,\n",
      "with his cottage in its setting, and the free and independent life\n",
      "of far-away wilds. Perhaps the scenes of travel conjure themselves up\n",
      "before me, and pass and repass in my imagination all the more vividly,\n",
      "because I lead such a vegetable existence, that a call to travel would\n",
      "fall upon me like a thunderbolt. In the presence of this Cabuliwallah,\n",
      "I was immediately transported to the foot of arid mountain peaks,\n",
      "with narrow little defiles twisting in and out amongst their towering\n",
      "heights. I could see the string of camels bearing the merchandise, and\n",
      "the company of turbaned merchants, carrying some of their queer old\n",
      "firearms, and some of their spears, journeying downward towards\n",
      "the plains. I could see--but at some such point Mini's mother would\n",
      "intervene, imploring me to \"beware of that man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mini's mother is unfortunately a very timid lady. Whenever she hears a\n",
      "noise in the street, or sees people coming towards the house, she always\n",
      "jumps to the conclusion that they are either thieves, or drunkards, or\n",
      "snakes, or tigers, or malaria or cockroaches, or caterpillars, or an\n",
      "English sailor. Even after all these years of experience, she is\n",
      "not able to overcome her terror. So she was full of doubts about the\n",
      "Cabuliwallah, and used to beg me to keep a watchful eye on him.\n",
      "\n",
      "I tried to laugh her fear gently away, but then she would turn round on\n",
      "me seriously, and ask me solemn questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Were children never kidnapped?\n",
      "\n",
      "Was it, then, not true that there was slavery in Cabul?\n",
      "\n",
      "Was it so very absurd that this big man should be able to carry off a\n",
      "tiny child?\n",
      "\n",
      "I urged that, though not impossible, it was highly improbable. But this\n",
      "was not enough, and her dread persisted. As it was indefinite, however,\n",
      "it did not seem right to forbid the man the house, and the intimacy went\n",
      "on unchecked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once a year in the middle of January Rahmun, the Cabuliwallah, was in\n",
      "the habit of returning to his country, and as the time approached he\n",
      "would be very busy, going from house to house collecting his debts. This\n",
      "year, however, he could always find time to come and see Mini. It would\n",
      "have seemed to an outsider that there was some conspiracy between the\n",
      "two, for when he could not come in the morning, he would appear in the\n",
      "evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even to me it was a little startling now and then, in the corner of\n",
      "a dark room, suddenly to surprise this tall, loose-garmented, much\n",
      "bebagged man; but when Mini would run in smiling, with her, \"O!\n",
      "Cabuliwallah! Cabuliwallah!\" and the two friends, so far apart in\n",
      "age, would subside into their old laughter and their old jokes, I felt\n",
      "reassured.\n",
      "\n",
      "One morning, a few days before he had made up his mind to go, I was\n",
      "correcting my proof sheets in my study. It was chilly weather. Through\n",
      "the window the rays of the sun touched my feet, and the slight warmth\n",
      "was very welcome. It was almost eight o'clock, and the early pedestrians\n",
      "were returning home, with their heads covered. All at once, I heard an\n",
      "uproar in the street, and, looking out, saw Rahmun being led away bound\n",
      "between two policemen, and behind them a crowd of curious boys. There\n",
      "were blood-stains on the clothes of the Cabuliwallah, and one of the\n",
      "policemen carried a knife. Hurrying out, I stopped them, and enquired\n",
      "what it all meant. Partly from one, partly from another, I gathered that\n",
      "a certain neighbour had owed the pedlar something for a Rampuri shawl,\n",
      "but had falsely denied having bought it, and that in the course of the\n",
      "quarrel, Rahmun had struck him. Now in the heat of his excitement, the\n",
      "prisoner began calling his enemy all sorts of names, when suddenly in\n",
      "a verandah of my house appeared my little Mini, with her usual\n",
      "exclamation: \"O Cabuliwallah! Cabuliwallah!\" Rahmun's face lighted up\n",
      "as he turned to her. He had no bag under his arm today, so she could not\n",
      "discuss the elephant with him. She at once therefore proceeded to the\n",
      "next question: \"Are you going to the father-in-law's house?\" Rahmun\n",
      "laughed and said: \"Just where I am going, little one!\" Then seeing that\n",
      "the reply did not amuse the child, he held up his fettered hands. \"Ali,\"\n",
      "he said, \"I would have thrashed that old father-in-law, but my hands are\n",
      "bound!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On a charge of murderous assault, Rahmun was sentenced to some years'\n",
      "imprisonment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Time passed away, and he was not remembered. The accustomed work in the\n",
      "accustomed place was ours, and the thought of the once-free mountaineer\n",
      "spending his years in prison seldom or never occurred to us. Even my\n",
      "light-hearted Mini, I am ashamed to say, forgot her old friend. New\n",
      "companions filled her life. As she grew older, she spent more of her\n",
      "time with girls. So much time indeed did she spend with them that she\n",
      "came no more, as she used to do, to her father's room. I was scarcely on\n",
      "speaking terms with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Years had passed away. It was once more autumn and we had made\n",
      "arrangements for our Mini's marriage. It was to take place during the\n",
      "Puja Holidays. With Durga returning to Kailas, the light of our home\n",
      "also was to depart to her husband's house, and leave her father's in the\n",
      "shadow.\n",
      "\n",
      "The morning was bright. After the rains, there was a sense of ablution\n",
      "in the air, and the sun-rays looked like pure gold. So bright were they\n",
      "that they gave a beautiful radiance even to the sordid brick walls of\n",
      "our Calcutta lanes. Since early dawn to-day the wedding-pipes had been\n",
      "sounding, and at each beat my own heart throbbed. The wail of the tune,\n",
      "Bhairavi, seemed to intensify my pain at the approaching separation. My\n",
      "Mini was to be married to-night.\n",
      "\n",
      "From early morning noise and bustle had pervaded the house. In\n",
      "the courtyard the canopy had to be slung on its bamboo poles; the\n",

      "said: \"May I not see the little one, sir, for a moment?\" It was his\n",
      "belief that Mini was still the same. He had pictured her running to him\n",
      "as she used, calling \"O Cabuliwallah! Cabuliwallah!\" He had imagined\n",
      "too that they would laugh and talk together, just as of old. In fact, in\n",
      "memory of former days he had brought, carefully wrapped up in paper, a\n",
      "few almonds and raisins and grapes, obtained somehow from a countryman,\n",
      "for his own little fund was dispersed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I said again: \"There is a ceremony in the house, and you will not be\n",
      "able to see any one to-day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The man's face fell. He looked wistfully at me for a moment, said \"Good\n",
      "morning,\" and went out. I felt a little sorry, and would have called him\n",
      "back, but I found he was returning of his own accord. He came close up\n",
      "to me holding out his offerings and said: \"I brought these few things,\n",
      "sir, for the little one. Will you give them to her?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I took them and was going to pay him, but he caught my hand and said:\n",
      "\"You are very kind, sir! Keep me in your recollection. Do not offer me\n",
      "money!--You have a little girl, I too have one like her in my own home.\n",
      "I think of her, and bring fruits to your child, not to make a profit for\n",
      "myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Saying this, he put his hand inside his big loose robe, and brought out\n",
      "a small and dirty piece of paper. With great care he unfolded this, and\n",
      "smoothed it out with both hands on my table. It bore the impression of\n",
      "a little band. Not a photograph. Not a drawing. The impression of an\n",
      "ink-smeared hand laid flat on the paper. This touch of his own little\n",
      "daughter had been always on his heart, as he had come year after year to\n",
      "Calcutta, to sell his wares in the streets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tears came to my eyes. I forgot that he was a poor Cabuli fruit-seller,\n",
      "while I was--but no, what was I more than he? He also was a father. That\n",
      "impression of the hand of his little Parbati in her distant mountain\n",
      "home reminded me of my own little Mini.\n",
      "\n",

      "were raised, but I would not listen. Clad in the red silk of her\n",
      "wedding-day, with the sandal paste on her forehead, and adorned as a\n",
      "young bride, Mini came, and stood bashfully before me.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Cabuliwallah looked a little staggered at the apparition. He could\n",
      "not revive their old friendship. At last he smiled and said: \"Little\n",
      "one, are you going to your father-in-law's house?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Mini now understood the meaning of the word \"father-in-law,\" and she\n",
      "could not reply to him as of old. She flushed up at the question, and\n",
      "stood before him with her bride-like face turned down.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remembered the day when the Cabuliwallah and my Mini had first met,\n",
      "and I felt sad. When she had gone, Rahmun heaved a deep sigh, and sat\n",
      "down on the floor. The idea had suddenly come to him that his daughter\n",
      "too must have grown in this long time, and that he would have to make\n",
      "friends with her anew. Assuredly he would not find her, as he used to\n",
      "know her. And besides, what might not have happened to her in these\n",
      "eight years?\n",
      "\n",
      "The marriage-pipes sounded, and the mild autumn sun streamed round\n",

      "\n",
      "I took out a bank-note, and gave it to him, saying: \"Go back to your\n",

'' as we had never stir out of our home before , the demeanour of the man struck us dumb with wonder . be the topic ever so trivial , he would quot scienc , or comment on the veda , or repeat quatrain from some persian poet ; and as we had no pretenc to a knowledg of scienc or the veda or persian , our admir for him went on increas , and my kinsman , a theosophist , was firm convinc that our fellow-passeng must have been supernatur inspir by some strang `` magnet '' or `` occult power , '' by an `` astral bodi '' or someth of that kind . he listen to the tritest say that fell from the lip of our extraordinari companion with devot raptur , and secret took down note of his convers . i fanci that the extraordinari man saw this , and was a littl pleas with it . when the train reach the junction , we assembl in the wait room for the connect . it was then 10 p.m. , and as the train , we heard , was like to be very late , owe to someth wrong in the line , i spread my bed on the tabl and was about to lie down for a comfort doze , when the extraordinari person deliber set about spin the follow yarn . of cours , i could get no sleep that night . when , owe to a disagr about some question of administr polici , i threw up my post at junagarh , and enter the servic of the nizam of hydria , they appoint me at once , as a strong young man , collector of cotton duti at barich . barich is a love place . the susta `` chatter over stoni way and babbl on the pebbl , '' trip , like a skil danc girl , in through the wood below the lone hill . a flight of 150 step rise from the river , and above that flight , on the river 's brim and at the foot of the hill , there stand a solitari marbl palac . around it there is no habit of man -- the villag and the cotton mart of barich being far off . about 250 year ago the emperor mahmud shah ii . had built this lone palac for his pleasur and luxuri . in his day jet of rose-wat spurt from its fountain , and on the cold marbl floor of its spray-cool room young persian damsel would sit , their hair dishevel before bath , and , splash their soft nake feet in the clear water of the reservoir , would sing , to the tune of the guitar , the ghazal of their vineyard . the fountain play no longer ; the song have ceas ; no longer do snow-whit feet step grace on the snowi marbl . it is but the vast and solitari quarter of cess-collector like us , men oppress with solitud and depriv of the societi of women . now , karim khan , the old clerk of my offic , warn me repeat not to take up my abod there . `` pass the day there , if you like , '' said he , `` but never stay the night . '' i pass it off with a light laugh . the servant said that they would work till dark and go away at night . i gave my readi assent . the hous had such a bad name that even thiev would not ventur near it after dark . at first the solitud of the desert palac weigh upon me like a nightmar . i would stay out , and work hard as long as possibl , then return home at night jade and tire , go to bed and fall asleep . before a week had pass , the place began to exert a weird fascin upon me . it is difficult to describ or to induc peopl to believ ; but i felt as if the whole hous was like a live organ slowli and impercept digest me by the action of some stupefi gastric juic . perhap the process had begun as soon as i set my foot in the hous , but i distinct rememb the day on which i first was conscious of it . it was the begin of summer , and the market being dull i had no work to do . a littl before sunset i was sit in an arm-chair near the water 's edg below the step . the susta had shrunk and sunk low ; a broad patch of sand on the other side glow with the hue of even ; on this side the pebbl at the bottom of the clear shallow water were glisten . there was not a breath of wind anywher , and the still air was laden with an oppress scent from the spici shrub grow on the hill close by . as the sun sank behind the hill-top a long dark curtain fell upon the stage of day , and the interven hill cut short the time in which light and shade mingl at sunset . i thought of go out for a ride , and was about to get up when i heard a footfal on the step behind . i look back , but there was no one . as i sat down again , think it to be an illus , i heard mani footfal , as if a larg number of person were rush down the step . a strang thrill of delight , slight ting with fear , pass through my frame , and though there was not a figur before my eye , methought i saw a bevi of joyous maiden come down the step to bath in the susta in that summer even . not a sound was in the valley , in the river , or in the palac , to break the silenc , but i distinct heard the maiden gay and mirth laugh , like the gurgl of a spring gush forth in a hundr cascad , as they ran past me , in quick play pursuit of each other , toward the river , without notic me at all . as they were invis to me , so i was , as it were , invis to them . the river was perfect calm , but i felt that its still , shallow , and clear water were stir sudden by the splash of mani an arm jingl with bracelet , that the girl laugh and dash and spatter water at one anoth , that the feet of the fair swimmer toss the tini wave up in shower of pearl . i felt a thrill at my heart -- i can not say whether the excit was due to fear or delight or curios . i had a strong desir to see them more clear , but naught was visibl before me ; i thought i could catch all that they said if i only strain my ear ; but howev hard i strain them , i heard noth but the chirp of the cicada in the wood . it seem as if a dark curtain of 250 year was hang before me , and i would fain lift a corner of it trembl and peer through , though the assembl on the other side was complet envelop in dark . the oppress close of the even was broken by a sudden gust of wind , and the still surfac of the suista rippl and curl like the hair of a nymph , and from the wood wrapt in the even gloom there came forth a simultan murmur , as though they were awaken from a black dream . call it realiti or dream , the momentari glimps of that invis mirag reflect from a far-off world , 250 year old , vanish in a flash . the mystic form that brush past me with their quick unbodi step , and loud , voiceless laughter , and threw themselves into the river , did not go back wring their drip robe as they went . like fragranc waft away by the wind they were dispers by a singl breath of the spring . then i was fill with a live fear that it was the muse that had taken advantag of my solitud and possess me -- the witch had evid come to ruin a poor devil like myself make a live by collect cotton duti . i decid to have a good dinner -- it is the empti stomach that all sort of incur diseas find an easi prey . i sent for my cook and gave order for a rich , sumptuous moghlai dinner , redol of spice and ghi . next morn the whole affair appear a queer fantasi . with a light heart i put on a sola hat like the saheb , and drove out to my work . i was to have written my quarter report that day , and expect to return late ; but before it was dark i was strang drawn to my hous -- by what i could not say -- i felt they were all wait , and that i should delay no longer . leav my report unfinish i rose , put on my sola hat , and startl the dark , shadi , desol path with the rattl of my carriag , i reach the vast silent palac stand on the gloomi skirt of the hill . on the first floor the stair led to a very spacious hall , its roof stretch wide over ornament arch rest on three row of massiv pillar , and groan day and night under the weight of its own intens solitud . the day had just close , and the lamp had not yet been light . as i push the door open a great bustl seem to follow within , as if a throng of peopl had broken up in confus , and rush out through the door and window and corridor and veranda and room , to make its hurri escap . as i saw no one i stood bewild , my hair on end in a kind of ecstat delight , and a faint scent of attar and unguent almost effect by age linger in my nostril . stand in the dark of that vast desol hall between the row of those ancient pillar , i could hear the gurgl of fountain plash on the marbl floor , a strang tune on the guitar , the jingl of ornament and the tinkl of anklet , the clang of bell toll the hour , the distant note of nahabat , the din of the crystal pendant of chandeli shaken by the breez , the song of bulbul from the cage in the corridor , the cackl of stork in the garden , all creat round me a strang unearth music . then i came under such a spell that this intang , inaccess , unearth vision appear to be the only realiti in the world -- and all els a mere dream . that i , that is to say , srijut so-and-so , the eldest son of so-and-so of bless memori , should be draw a month salari of rs . 450 by the discharg of my duti as collector of cotton duti , and drive in my dog-cart to my offic everi day in a short coat and soia hat , appear to me to be such an astonish ludicr illus that i burst into a horse-laugh , as i stood in the gloom of that vast silent hall . at that moment my servant enter with a light kerosen lamp in his hand . i do not know whether he thought me mad , but it came back to me at once that i was in very deed srijut so-and-so , son of so-and-so of bless memori , and that , while our poet , great and small , alon could say whether insid of or outsid the earth there was a region where unseen fountain perpetu play and fairi guitar , struck by invis finger , sent forth an etern harmoni , this at any rate was certain , that i collect duti at the cotton market at banch , and earn therebi rs . 450 per mensem as my salari . i laugh in great glee at my curious illus , as i sat over the newspap at my camp-tabl , light by the kerosen lamp . after i had finish my paper and eaten my moghlai dinner , i put out the lamp , and lay down on my bed in a small side-room . through the open window a radiant star , high above the aval hill skirt by the dark of their wood , was gaze intent from million and million of mile away in the sky at mr. collector lie on a humbl camp-bedstead . i wonder and felt amus at the idea , and do not knew when i fell asleep or how long i slept ; but i sudden awok with a start , though i heard no sound and saw no intrud -- only the steadi bright star on the hilltop had set , and the dim light of the new moon was stealthili enter the room through the open window , as if asham of its intrus . i saw nobodi , but felt as if some one was gentl push me . as i awok she said not a word , but beckon me with her five finger bedeck with ring to follow her cautious . i got up noiseless , and , though not a soul save myself was there in the countless apart of that desert palac with its slumber sound and wait echo , i fear at everi step lest any one should wake up . most of the room of the palac were alway kept close , and i had never enter them . i follow breathless and with silent step my invis guid -- i can not now say where . what endless dark and narrow passag , what long corridor , what silent and solemn audience-chamb and close secret cell i cross ! though i could not see my fair guid , her form was not invis to my mind 's eye , -- an arab girl , her arm , hard and smooth as marbl , visibl through her loos sleev , a thin veil fall on her face from the fring of her cap , and a curv dagger at her waist ! methought that one of the thousand and one arabian night had been waft to me from the world of romanc , and that at the dead of night i was wend my way through the dark narrow alley of slumber bagdad to a trysting-plac fraught with peril . at last my fair guid stop abrupt before a deep blue screen , and seem to point to someth below . there was noth there , but a sudden dread froze the blood in my heart-methought i saw there on the floor at the foot of the screen a terribl negro eunuch dress in rich brocad , sit and doze with outstretch leg , with a nake sword on his lap . my fair guid light trip over his leg and held up a fring of the screen . i could catch a glimps of a part of the room spread with a persian carpet -- some one was sit insid on a bed -- i could not see her , but only caught a glimps of two exquisit feet in gold-embroid slipper , hang out from loos saffron-colour paijama and place idl on the orange-colour velvet carpet . on one side there was a bluish crystal tray on which a few appl , pear , orang , and bunch of grape in plenti , two small cup and a gold-tint decant were evid wait the guest . a fragrant intox vapour , issu from a strang sort of incens that burn within , almost overpow my sens . as with trembl heart i made an attempt to step across the outstretch leg of the eunuch , he woke up sudden with a start , and the sword fell from his lap with a sharp clang on the marbl floor . a terrif scream made me jump , and i saw i was sit on that camp-bedstead of mine sweat heavili ; and the crescent moon look pale in the morn light like a weari sleepless patient at dawn ; and our crazi meher ali was cri out , as is his daili custom , `` stand back ! stand back ! ! '' while he went along the lone road . such was the abrupt close of one of my arabian night ; but there were yet a thousand night left . then follow a great discord between my day and night . during the day i would go to my work worn and tire , curs the bewitch night and her empti dream , but as night came my daili life with its bond and shackl of work would appear a petti , fals , ludicr vaniti . after nightfal i was caught and overwhelm in the snare of a strang intox , i would then be transform into some unknown personag of a bygon age , play my part in unwritten histori ; and my short english coat and tight breech did not suit me in the least . with a red velvet cap on my head , loos paijama , an embroid vest , a long flow silk gown , and colour handkerchief scent with attar , i would complet my elabor toilet , sit on a high-cushion chair , and replac my cigarett with a many-coil narghileh fill with rose-wat , as if in eager expect of a strang meet with the belov one . i have no power to describ the marvel incid that unfold themselves , as the gloom of the night deepen . i felt as if in the curious apart of that vast edific the fragment of a beauti stori , which i could follow for some distanc , but of which i could never see the end , flew about in a sudden gust of the vernal breez . and all the same i would wander from room to room in pursuit of them the whole night long . amid the eddi of these dream-frag , amid the smell of henna and the twang of the guitar , amid the wave of air charg with fragrant spray , i would catch like a flash of lightn the momentari glimps of a fair damsel . she it was who had saffron-colour paijama , white ruddi soft feet in gold-embroid slipper with curv toe , a close-fit bodic wrought with gold , a red cap , from which a golden frill fell on her snowi brow and cheek . she had madden me . in pursuit of her i wander from room to room , from path to path among the bewild maze of alley in the enchant dreamland of the nether world of sleep . sometim in the even , while array myself care as a princ of the blood-roy before a larg mirror , with a candl burn on either side , i would see a sudden reflect of the persian beauti by the side of my own . a swift turn of her neck , a quick eager glanc of intens passion and pain glow in her larg dark eye , just a suspicion of speech on her dainti red lip , her figur , fair and slim crown with youth like a blossom creeper , quick uplift in her grace tilt gait , a dazzl flash of pain and crave and ecstasi , a smile and a glanc and a blaze of jewel and silk , and she melt away . a wild glist of wind , laden with all the fragranc of hill and wood , would put out my light , and i would fling asid my dress and lie down on my bed , my eye close and my bodi thrill with delight , and there around me in the breez , amid all the perfum of the wood and hill , float through the silent gloom mani a caress and mani a kiss and mani a tender touch of hand , and gentl murmur in my ear , and fragrant breath on my brow ; or a sweetly-perfum kerchief was waft again and again on my cheek . then slowli a mysteri serpent would twist her stupefi coil about me ; and heav a heavi sigh , i would laps into insens , and then into a profound slumber . one even i decid to go out on my hors -- i do not know who implor me to stay-but i would listen to no entreati that day . my english hat and coat were rest on a rack , and i was about to take them down when a sudden whirlwind , crest with the sand of the susta and the dead leav of the aval hill , caught them up , and whirl them round and round , while a loud peal of merri laughter rose higher and higher , strike all the chord of mirth till it die away in the land of sunset . i could not go out for my ride , and the next day i gave up my queer english coat and hat for good . that day again at dead of night i heard the stifl heart-break sob of some one -- as if below the bed , below the floor , below the stoni foundat of that gigant palac , from the depth of a dark damp grave , a voic piteous cri and implor me : `` oh , rescu me ! break through these door of hard illus , deathlik slumber and fruitless dream , place by your side on the saddl , press me to your heart , and , ride through hill and wood and across the river , take me to the warm radianc of your sunni room above ! '' who am i ? oh , how can i rescu thee ? what drown beauti , what incarn passion shall i drag to the shore from this wild eddi of dream ? o love ether apparit ! where didst thou flourish and when ? by what cool spring , under the shade of what date-grov , wast thou born -- in the lap of what homeless wander in the desert ? what bedouin snatch thee from thi mother 's arm , an open bud pluck from a wild creeper , place thee on a hors swift as lightn , cross the burn sand , and took thee to the slave-market of what royal citi ? and there , what offic of the badshah , see the glori of thi bash blossom youth , paid for thee in gold , place thee in a golden palanquin , and offer thee as a present for the seraglio of his master ? and o , the histori of that place ! the music of the sareng , the jingl of anklet , the occasion flash of dagger and the glow wine of shiraz poison , and the pierc flash glanc ! what infinit grandeur , what endless servitud ! the slave-girl to thi right and left wave the chamar as diamond flash from their bracelet ; the badshah , the king of king , fell on his knee at thi snowi feet in bejewel shoe , and outsid the terribl abyssinian eunuch , look like a messeng of death , but cloth like an angel , stood with a nake sword in his hand ! then , o , thou flower of the desert , swept away by the blood-stain dazzl ocean of grandeur , with its foam of jealousi , its rock and shoal of intrigu , on what shore of cruel death wast thou cast , or in what other land more splendid and more cruel ? sudden at this moment that crazi meher ali scream out : `` stand back ! stand back ! ! all is fals ! all is fals ! ! '' i open my eye and saw that it was alreadi light . my chaprasi came and hand me my letter , and the cook wait with a salam for my order . i said ; `` no , i can stay here no longer . '' that very day i pack up , and move to my offic . old karim khan smile a littl as he saw me . i felt nettl , but said noth , and fell to my work . as even approach i grew absent-mind ; i felt as if i had an appoint to keep ; and the work of examin the cotton account seem wholli useless ; even the nizamat of the nizam did not appear to be of much worth . whatev belong to the present , whatev was move and act and work for bread seem trivial , meaningless , and contempt . i threw my pen down , close my ledger , got into my dog-cart , and drove away . i notic that it stop of itself at the gate of the marbl palac just at the hour of twilight . with quick step i climb the stair , and enter the room . a heavi silenc was reign within . the dark room were look sullen as if they had taken offenc . my heart was full of contrit , but there was no one to whom i could lay it bare , or of whom i could ask forgiv . i wander about the dark room with a vacant mind . i wish i had a guitar to which i could sing to the unknown : `` o fire , the poor moth that made a vain effort to fli away has come back to thee ! forgiv it but this once , burn its wing and consum it in thi flame ! '' sudden two tear-drop fell from overhead on my brow . dark mass of cloud overcast the top of the aval hill that day . the gloomi wood and the sooti water of the susta were wait in terribl suspens and in an omin calm . sudden land , water , and sky shiver , and a wild tempest-blast rush howl through the distant pathless wood , show its lightning-teeth like a rave maniac who had broken his chain . the desol hall of the palac bang their door , and moan in the bitter of anguish . the servant were all in the offic , and there was no one to light the lamp . the night was cloudi and moonless . in the dens gloom within i could distinct feel that a woman was lie on her face on the carpet below the bed -- clasp and tear her long dishevel hair with desper finger . blood was trick down her fair brow , and she was now laugh a hard , harsh , mirthless laugh , now burst into violent wring sob , now rend her bodic and strike at her bare bosom , as the wind roar in through the open window , and the rain pour in torrent and soak her through and through . all night there was no cessat of the storm or of the passion cri . i wander from room to room in the dark , with unavail sorrow . whom could i consol when no one was by ? whose was this intens agoni of sorrow ? whenc aros this inconsol grief ? and the mad man cri out : `` stand back ! stand back ! ! all is fals ! all is fals ! ! '' i saw that the day had dawn , and meher ali was go round and round the palac with his usual cri in that dread weather . sudden it came to me that perhap he also had once live in that hous , and that , though he had gone mad , he came there everi day , and went round and round , fascin by the weird spell cast by the marbl demon . despit the storm and rain i ran to him and ask : `` ho , meher ali , what is fals ? '' the man answer noth , but push me asid went round and round with his frantic cri , like a bird fli fascin about the jaw of a snake , and made a desper effort to warn himself by repeat : `` stand back ! stand back ! ! all is fals ! all is fals ! ! '' i ran like a mad man through the pelt rain to my offic , and ask karim khan : `` tell me the mean of all this ! '' what i gather from that old man was this : that at one time countless unrequit passion and unsatisfi long and lurid flame of wild blaze pleasur rage within that palac , and that the curs of all the heart-ach and blast hope had made its everi stone thirsti and hungri , eager to swallow up like a famish ogress any live man who might chanc to approach . not one of those who live there for three consecut night could escap these cruel jaw , save meher ali , who had escap at the cost of his reason . i ask : `` is there no mean whatev of my releas ? '' the old man said : '' there is only one mean , and that is very difficult . i will tell you what it is , but first you must hear the histori of a young persian girl who once live in that pleasure-dom . a stranger or a more bitter heart-rend tragedi was never enact on this earth . '' just at this moment the cooli announc that the train was come . so soon ? we hurri pack up our luggag , as the tram steam in . an english gentleman , appar just arous from slumber , was look out of a first-class carriag endeavour to read the name of the station . as soon as he caught sight of our fellow-passeng , he cri , `` hallo , '' and took him into his own compart . as we got into a second-class carriag , we had no chanc of find out who the man was nor what was the end of his stori . i said ; `` the man evid took us for fool and impos upon us out of fun . the stori is pure fabric from start to finish . '' the discuss that follow end in a lifelong ruptur between my theosophist kinsman and myself . the victori she was the princess ajita . and the court poet of king narayan had never seen her . on the day he recit a new poem to the king he would rais his voic just to that pitch which could be heard by unseen hearer in the screen balconi high above the hall . he sent up his song toward the star-land out of his reach , where , circl with light , the planet who rule his destini shone unknown and out of ken . he would espi some shadow move behind the veil . a tinkl sound would come to his car from afar , and would set him dream of the ankl whose tini golden bell sang at each step . ah , the rosi red tender feet that walk the dust of the earth like god 's merci on the fallen ! the poet had place them on the altar of his heart , where he wove his song to the tune of those golden bell . doubt never aros in his mind as to whose shadow it was that move behind the screen , and whose anklet they were that sang to the time of his beat heart . manjari , the maid of the princess , pass by the poet 's hous on her way to the river , and she never miss a day to have a few word with him on the sli . when she found the road desert , and the shadow of dusk on the land , she would bold enter his room , and sit at the corner of his carpet . there was a suspicion of an ad care in the choic of the colour of her veil , in the set of the flower in her hair . peopl smile and whisper at this , and they were not to blame . for shekhar the poet never took the troubl to hide the fact that these meet were a pure joy to him . the mean of her name was the spray of flower . one must confess that for an ordinari mortal it was suffici in its sweet . but shekhar made his own addit to this name , and call her the spray of spring flower . and ordinari mortal shook their head and said , ah , me ! in the spring song that the poet sang the prais of the spray of spring flower was conspicu reiter ; and the king wink and smile at him when he heard it , and the poet smile in answer . the king would put him the question ; `` is it the busi of the bee mere to hum in the court of the spring ? '' the poet would answer ; `` no , but also to sip the honey of the spray of spring flower . '' and they all laugh in the king 's hall . and it was rumour that the princess akita also laugh at her maid 's accept the poet 's name for her , and manjari felt glad in her heart . thus truth and falsehood mingl in life -- and to what god build man add his own decor . only those were pure truth which were sung by the poet . the theme was krishna , the lover god , and radha , the belov , the etern man and the etern woman , the sorrow that come from the begin of time , and the joy without end . the truth of these song was test in his inmost heart by everybodi from the beggar to the king himself . the poet 's song were on the lip of all . at the merest glimmer of the moon and the faintest whisper of the summer breez his song would break forth in the land from window and courtyard , from sailing-boat , from shadow of the waysid tree , in numberless voic . thus pass the day happili . the poet recit , the king listen , the hearer applaud , manjari pass and repass by the poet 's room on her way to the river -- the shadow flit behind the screen balconi , and the tini golden bell tinkl from afar . just then set forth from his home in the south a poet on his path of conquest . he came to king narayan , in the kingdom of amarapur . he stood before the throne , and utter a vers in prais of the king . he had challeng all the court poet on his way , and his career of victori had been unbroken . the king receiv him with honour , and said : `` poet , i offer you welcom . '' pundarik , the poet , proud repli : `` sire , i ask for war . '' shekhar , the court poet of the king did not know how the battl of the muse was to be wage . he had no sleep at night . the mighti figur of the famous pundarik , his sharp nose curv like a scimitar , and his proud head tilt on one side , haunt the poet 's vision in the dark . with a trembl heart shekhar enter the arena in the morn . the theatr was fill with the crowd . the poet greet his rival with a smile and a bow . pundarik return it with a slight toss of his head , and turn his face toward his circl of ador follow with a mean smile . shekhar cast his glanc toward the screen balconi high above , and salut his ladi in his mind , say ! `` if i am the winner at the combat to-day , my ladi , thi victori name shall be glorifi . '' the trumpet sound . the great crowd stood up , shout victori to the king . the king , dress in an ampl robe of white , slowli came into the hall like a float cloud of autumn , and sat on his throne . pundarik stood up , and the vast hall becam still . with his head rais high and chest expand , he began in his thunder voic to recit the prais of king narayan . his word burst upon the wall of the hall like breaker of the sea , and seem to rattl against the rib of the listen crowd . the skill with which he gave vari mean to the name narayan , and wove each letter of it through the web of his vers in all marin of combin , took away the breath of his amaz hearer . for some minut after he took his seat his voic continu to vibrat among the numberless pillar of the king 's court and in thousand of speechless heart . the learn professor who had come from distant land rais their right hand , and cri , bravo ! the king threw a glanc on shekhar 's face , and shekhar in answer rais for a moment his eye full of pain toward his master , and then stood up like a stricken deer at bay . his face was pale , his bash was almost that of a woman , his slight youth figur , delic in its outlin , seem like a tens strung vina readi to break out in music at the least touch . his head was bent , his voic was low , when he began . the first few vers were almost inaud . then he slowli rais his head , and his clear sweet voic rose into the sky like a quiver flame of fire . he began with the ancient legend of the king line lost in the haze of the past , and brought it down through its long cours of heroism and matchless generos to the present age . he fix his gaze on the king face , and all the vast and unexpress love of the peopl for the royal hous rose like incens in his song , and enwreath the throne on all side . these were his last word when , trembl , he took his seat : `` my master , i may be beaten in play of word , but not in my love for thee . '' tear fill the eye of the hearer , and the stone wall shook with cri of victori . mock this popular outburst of feel , with an august shake of his head and a contemptu sneer , pundarik stood up , and flung this question to the assembl ; `` what is there superior to word ? '' in a moment the hall laps into silenc again . then with a marvel display of learn , he prove that the word was in the begin , that the word was god . he pile up quotat from scriptur , and built a high altar for the word to be seat above all that there is in heaven and in earth . he repeat that question in his mighti voic : `` what is there superior to word ? '' proud he look around him . none dare to accept his challeng , and he slowli took his seat like a lion who had just made a full meal of its victim . the pandit shout , bravo ! the king remain silent with wonder , and the poet shekhar felt himself of no account by the side of this stupend learn . the assembl broke up for that day . next day shekhar began his song . it was of that day when the pipe of love 's flute startl for the first time the hush air of the vrinda forest . the shepherd women did not know who was the player or whenc came the music . sometim it seem to come from the heart of the south wind , and sometim from the stray cloud of the hilltop . it came with a messag of tryst from the land of the sunris , and it float from the verg of sunset with its sigh of sorrow . the star seem to be the stop of the instrument that flood the dream of the night with melodi . the music seem to burst all at once from all side , from field and grove , from the shadi lane and lone road , from the melt blue of the sky , from the shimmer green of the grass . they neither knew its mean nor could they find word to give utter to the desir of their heart . tear fill their eye , and their life seem to long for a death that would be its consumm . shekhar forgot his audienc , forgot the trial of his strength with a rival . he stood alon amid his thought that rustl and quiver round him like leav in a summer breez , and sang the song of the flute . he had in his mind the vision of an imag that had taken its shape from a shadow , and the echo of a faint tinkl sound of a distant footstep . he took his seat . his hearer trembl with the sad of an indefin delight , immens and vagu , and they forgot to applaud him . as this feel die away pundarik stood up before the throne and challeng his rival to defin who was this lover and who was the belov . he arrog look around him , he smile at his follow and then put the question again : `` who is krishna , the lover , and who is radha , the belov ? '' then he began to analys the root of those name , -- and various interpret of their mean . he brought before the bewild audienc all the intricaci of the differ school of metaphys with consumm skill . each letter of those name he divid from its fellow , and then pursu them with a relentless logic till they fell to the dust in confus , to be caught up again and restor to a mean never before imagin by the subtlest of word-mong . the pandit were in ecstasi ; they applaud vocifer ; and the crowd follow them , delud into the certainti that they had wit , that day , the last shred of the curtain of truth torn to piec before their eye by a prodigi of intellect . the perform of his tremend feat so delight them that they forgot to ask themselves if there was any truth behind it after all . the king 's mind was overwhelm with wonder . the atmospher was complet clear of all illus of music , and the vision of the world around seem to be chang from its fresh of tender green to the solid of a high road level and made hard with crush stone . to the peopl assembl their own poet appear a mere boy in comparison with this giant , who walk with such case , knock down difficulti at each step in the world of word and thought . it becam evid to them for the first time that the poem shekhar wrote were absurd simpl , and it must be a mere accid that they did not write them themselves . they were neither new , nor difficult , nor instruct , nor necessari . the king tri to goad his poet with keen glanc , silent incit him to make a final effort . but shekhar took no notic , and remain fix to his seat . the king in anger came down from his throne -- took off his pearl chain and put it on pundarik 's head . everybodi in the hall cheer . from the upper balconi came a slight sound of the movement of rustl robe and waist-chain hung with golden bell . shekhar rose from his seat and left the hall . it was a dark night of wane moon . the poet shekhar took down his mss . from his shelv and heap them on the floor . some of them contain his earliest write , which he had almost forgotten . he turn over the page , read passag here and there . they all seem to him poor and trivial -- mere word and childish rhyme ! one by one he tore his book to fragment , and threw them into a vessel contain fire , and said : `` to thee , to thee , o my beauti , my fire ! thou hast been burn in my heart all these futil year . if my life were a piec of gold it would come out of its trial brighter , but it is a trodden turf of grass , and noth remain of it but this hand of ash . '' the night wore on . shekhar open wide his window . he spread upon his bed the white flower that he love , the jasmin , tuberos and chrysanthemum , and brought into his bedroom all the lamp he had in his hous and light them . then mix with honey the juic of some poison root he drank it and lay down on his bed . golden anklet tinkl in the passag outsid the door , and a subtl perfum came into the room with the breez . the poet , with his eye shut , said ; `` my ladi , have you taken piti upon your servant at last and come to see him ? '' the answer came in a sweet voic `` my poet , i have come . '' shekhar open his eye -- and saw before his bed the figur of a woman . his sight was dim and blur . and it seem to him that the imag made of a shadow that he had ever kept throne in the secret shrine of his heart had come into the outer world in his last moment to gaze upon his face . the woman said ; `` i am the princess ajita . '' the poet with a great effort sat up on his bed . the princess whisper into his car : `` the king has not done you justic . it was you who won at the combat , my poet , and i have come to crown you with the crown of victori . '' she took the garland of flower from her own neck , and put it on his hair , and the poet fell down upon his bed stricken by death . once there was a king '' once upon a time there was a king . '' when we were children there was no need to know who the king in the fairi stori was . it did n't matter whether he was call shiladitya or shaliban , whether he live at kashi or kanauj . the thing that made a seven-year-old boy 's heart go thump , thump with delight was this one sovereign truth ; this realiti of all realiti : `` once there was a king . '' but the reader of this modern age are far more exact and exact . when they hear such an open to a stori , they are at once critic and suspici . they appli the searchlight of scienc to its legendari haze and ask : `` which king ? '' the story-tel have becom more precis in their turn . they are no longer content with the old indefinit , `` there was a king , '' but assum instead a look of profound learn , and begin : `` once there was a king name ajatasatru , '' the modern reader 's curios , howev , is not so easili satisfi . he blink at the author through his scientif spectacl , and ask again : '' which ajatasatru ? '' `` everi schoolboy know , '' the author proceed , `` that there were three ajatasatrus . the first was born in the twentieth centuri b.c. , and die at the tender age of two year and eight month , i deepli regret that it is imposs to find , from any trustworthi sourc , a detail account of his reign . the second ajatasatru is better known to historian . if you refer to the new encyclopedia of histori ... . '' by this time the modern reader 's suspicion are dissolv . he feel he may safe trust his author . he say to himself : `` now we shall have a stori that is both improv and instruct . '' ah ! how we all love to be delud ! we have a secret dread of being thought ignor . and we end by being ignor after all , only we have done it in a long and roundabout way . there is an english proverb ; `` ask me no question , and i will tell you no lie . '' the boy of seven who is listen to a fairi stori understand that perfect well ; he withhold his question , while the stori is being told . so the pure and beauti falsehood of it all remain nake and innoc as a babe ; transpar as truth itself ; limpid as afresh bubbl spring . but the ponder and learn lie of our modern has to keep its true charact drape and veil . and if there is discov anywher the least littl peep-hol of decept , the reader turn away with a prudish disgust , and the author is discredit . when we were young , we understood all sweet thing ; and we could detect the sweet of a fairi stori by an uner scienc of our own . we never care for such useless thing as knowledg . we only care for truth . and our unsophist littl heart knew well where the crystal palac of truth lay and how to reach it . but to-day we are expect to write page of fact , while the truth is simpli this : '' there was a king . '' i rememb vivid that even in calcutta when the fairi stori began . the rain and the storm had been incess . the whole of the citi was flood . the water was knee-deep in our lane . i had a strain hope , which was almost a certainti , that my tutor would be prevent from come that even . i sat on the stool in the far corner of the veranda look down the lane , with a heart beat faster and faster . everi minut i kept my eye on the rain , and when it began to grow less i pray with all my might ; `` pleas , god , send some more rain till half-past seven is over . '' for i was quit readi to believ that there was no other need for rain except to protect one helpless boy one even in one corner of calcutta from the dead clutch of his tutor . if not in answer to my prayer , at any rate accord to some grosser law of physic natur , the rain did not give up . but , ala ! nor did my teacher . exact to the minut , in the bend of the lane , i saw his approach umbrella . the great bubbl of hope burst in my breast , and my heart collaps . truli , if there is a punish to fit the crime after death , then my tutor will be born again as me , and i shall be born as my tutor . as soon as i saw his umbrella i ran as hard as i could to my mother room . my mother and my grandmoth were sit opposit one anoth play card by the light of a lamp . i ran into the room , and flung myself on the bed besid my mother , and said : '' mother dear , the tutor has come , and i have such a bad headach ; could n't i have no lesson today ? '' i hope no child of immatur age will be allow to read this stori , and i sincer trust it will not be use in text-book or primer for school . for what i did was dread bad , and i receiv no punish whatev . on the contrari , my wicked was crown with success . my mother said to me : `` all right , '' and turn to the servant ad : '' tell the tutor that he can go back home . '' it was perfect plain that she did n't think my ill very serious , as she went on with her game as before , and took no further notic . and i also , buri my head in the pillow , laugh to my heart 's content . we perfect understood one anoth , my mother and i . but everi one must know how hard it is for a boy of seven year old to keep up the illus of ill for a long time . after about a minut i got hold of grandmoth , and said : `` granni , do tell me a stori . '' i had to ask this mani time . granni and mother went on play card , and took no notic . at last mother said to me : `` child , do n't bother . wait till we ve finish our game . '' but i persist : `` granni , do tell me a stori . '' i told mother she could finish her game to-morrow , but she must let granni tell me a stori there and then . at last mother threw down the card and said : `` you had better do what he want . i ca n't manag him . '' perhap she had it in her mind that she would have no tiresom tutor on the morrow , while i should be oblig to be back to those stupid lesson . as soon as ever mother had given way , i rush at granni . i got hold of her hand , and , danc with delight , drag her insid my mosquito curtain on to the bed . i clutch hold of the bolster with both hand in my excit , and jump up and down with joy , and when i had got a littl quieter , said : `` now , granni , let ' s have the stori ! '' granni went on : `` and the king had a queen . '' that was good to begin with . he had only one . it is usual for king in fairi stori to be extravag in queen . and whenev we hear that there are two queen , our heart begin to sink . one is sure to be unhappi . but in granni 's stori that danger was past . he had only one queen . we next hear that the king had not got any son . at the age of seven i did n't think there was any need to bother if a man had had no son . he might only have been in the way . nor are we great excit when we hear that the king has gone away into the forest to practis auster in order to get a son . there was only one thing that would have made me go into the forest , and that was to get away from my tutor ! but the king left behind with his queen a small girl , who grew up into a beauti princess . twelv year pass away , and the king goe on practis auster , and never think all this while of his beauti daughter . the princess has reach the full bloom of her youth . the age of marriag has pass , but the king does not return . and the queen pine away with grief and cri : '' is my golden daughter destin to die unmarri ? ah me ! what a fate is mine . '' then the queen sent men to the king to entreat him earnest to come back for a singl night and take one meal in the palac . and the king consent . the queen cook with her own hand , and with the greatest care , sixty-four dish , and made a seat for him of sandal-wood , and arrang the food in plate of gold and cup of silver . the princess stood behind with the peacock-tail fan in her hand . the king , after twelv year absenc , came into the hous , and the princess wave the fan , light up all the room with her beauti . the king look in his daughter 's face , and forgot to take his food . at last he ask his queen : `` pray , who is this girl whose beauti shine as the gold imag of the goddess ? whose daughter is she ? '' the queen beat her forehead , and cri : `` ah , how evil is my fate ! do you not know your own daughter ? '' the king was struck with amaz . he said at last ; `` my tini daughter has grown to be a woman . '' `` what els ? '' the queen said with a sigh . `` do you not know that twelv year have pass by ? '' `` but why did you not give her in marriag ? '' ask the king . `` you were away , '' the queen said . `` and how could i find her a suitabl husband ? '' the king becam vehement with excit . `` the first man i see to-morrow , '' he said , `` when i come out of the palac shall marri her . '' the princess went on wave her fan of peacock feather , and the king finish his meal . the next morn , as the king came out of his palac , he saw the son of a brahman gather stick in the forest outsid the palac gate . his age was about seven or eight . the king said : `` i will marri my daughter to him . '' who can interfer with a king 's command ? at once the boy was call , and the marriag garland were exchang between him and the princess . at this point i came up close to my wise granni and ask her eager : '' what then ? '' in the bottom of my heart there was a devout wish to substitut myself for that fortun wood-gather of seven year old . the night was reson with the patter of rain . the earthen lamp by my bedsid was burn low . my grandmoth 's voic drone on as she told the stori . and all these thing serv to creat in a corner of my credul heart the belief that i had been gather stick in the dawn of some indefinit time in the kingdom of some unknown king , and in a moment garland had been exchang between me and the princess , beauti as the goddess of grace . she had a gold band on her hair and gold earring in her ear . she bad a necklac and bracelet of gold , and a golden waist-chain round her waist , and a pair of golden anklet tinkl above her feet . if my grandmoth were an author how mani explan she would have to offer for this littl stori ! first of all , everi one would ask why the king remain twelv year in the forest ? second , why should the king 's daughter remain unmarri all that while ? this would be regard as absurd . even if she could have got so far without a quarrel , still there would have been a great hue and cri about the marriag itself . first , it never happen . second , how could there be a marriag between a princess of the warrior cast and a boy of the priest brahman cast ? her reader would have imagin at once that the writer was preach against our social custom in an underhand way . and they would write letter to the paper . so i pray with all my heart that my grandmoth may be born a grandmoth again , and not through some curs fate take birth as her luckless grandson . so with a throb of joy and delight , i ask granni : `` what then ? '' granni went on : then the princess took her littl husband away in great distress , and built a larg palac with seven wing , and began to cherish her husband with great care . i jump up and down in my bed and clutch at the bolster more tight than ever and said : `` what then ? '' granni continu : the littl boy went to school and learnt mani lesson from his teacher , and as he grew up his class-fellow began to ask him : '' who is that beauti ladi who live with you in the palac with the seven wing ? '' the brahman 's son was eager to know who she was . he could only rememb how one day he had been gather stick , and a great disturb aros . but all that was so long ago , that he had no clear recollect . four or five year pass in this way . his companion alway ask him : '' who is that beauti ladi in the palac with the seven wing ? '' and the brahman 's son would come back from school and sad tell the princess : '' my school companion alway ask me who is that beauti ladi in the palac with the seven wing , and i can give them no repli . tell me , oh , tell me , who you are ! '' the princess said : `` let it pass to-day . i will tell you some other day . '' and everi day the brahman 's son would ask ; `` who are you ? '' and the princess would repli : `` let it pass to-day . i will tell you some other day . '' in this manner four or five more year pass away . at last the brahman 's son becam very impati , and said : `` if you do not tell me to-day who you are , o beauti ladi , i will leav this palac with the seven wing . '' then the princess said : `` i will certain tell you to-morrow . '' next day the brahman 's son , as soon as he came home from school , said : '' now , tell me who you are . '' the princess said : `` to-night i will tell you after supper , when you are in bed . '' the brahman 's son said : `` very well `` ; and he began to count the hour in expect of the night . and the princess , on her side , spread white flower over the golden bed , and light a gold lamp with fragrant oil , and adorn her hair , and dress herself in a beauti robe of blue , and began to count the hour in expect of the night . that even when her husband , the brahman 's son , had finish his meal , too excit almost to eat , and had gone to the golden bed in the bed-chamb strewn with flower , he said to himself : `` to-night i shall sure know who this beauti ladi is in the palac with the seven wing . '' the princess took for her the food that was left over by her husband , and slowli enter the bed-chamb . she had to answer that night the question , which was the beauti ladi who live in the palac with the seven wing . and as she went up to the bed to tell him she found a serpent had crept out of the flower and had bitten the brahman 's son . her boy-husband was lie on the bed of flower , with face pale in death . my heart sudden ceas to throb , and i ask with choke voic : `` what then ? '' granni said ; `` then ... '' but what is the use of go on any further with the stori ? it would only lead on to what was more and more imposs . the boy of seven did not know that , if there were some `` what then ? '' after death , no grandmoth of a grandmoth could tell us all about it . but the child 's faith never admit defeat , and it would snatch at the mantl of death itself to turn him back . it would be outrag for him to think that such a stori of one teacherless even could so sudden come to a stop . therefor the grandmoth had to call back her stori from the ever-shut chamber of the great end , but she does it so simpli : it is mere by float the dead bodi on a banana stem on the river , and having some incant read by a magician . but in that raini night and in the dim light of a lamp death lose all its horror in the mind of the boy , and seem noth more than a deep slumber of a singl night . when the stori end the tire eyelid are weigh down with sleep . thus it is that we send the littl bodi of the child float on the back of sleep over the still water of time , and then in the morn read a few vers of incant to restor him to the world of life and light . the home-com phatik chakravorti was ringlead among the boy of the villag . a new mischief got into his head . there was a heavi log lie on the mud-flat of the river wait to be shape into a mast for a boat . he decid that they should all work togeth to shift the log by main forc from its place and roll it away . the owner of the log would be angri and surpris , and they would all enjoy the fun . everi one second the propos , and it was carri unanim . but just as the fun was about to begin , makhan , phatik 's younger brother , saunter up , and sat down on the log in front of them all without a word . the boy were puzzl for a moment . he was push , rather timid , by one of the boy and told to get up but he remain quit unconcern . he appear like a young philosoph medit on the futil of game . phatik was furious . `` makhan , '' he cri , `` if you do n't get down this minut i ll thrash you ! '' makhan only move to a more comfort posit . now , if phatik was to keep his regal digniti before the public , it was clear he ought to carri out his threat . but his courag fail him at the crisi . his fertil brain , howev , rapid seiz upon a new manoeuvr which would discomfit his brother and afford his follow an ad amus . he gave the word of command to roll the log and makhan over togeth . makhan heard the order , and made it a point of honour to stick on . but he overlook the fact , like those who attempt earth fame in other matter , that there was peril in it . the boy began to heav at the log with all their might , call out , '' one , two , three , go , '' at the word `` go '' the log went ; and with it went makhan 's philosophi , glori and all . all the other boy shout themselves hoars with delight . but phatik was a littl frighten . he knew what was come . and , sure enough , makhan rose from mother earth blind as fate and scream like the furi . he rush at phatik and scratch his face and beat him and kick him , and then went cri home . the first act of the drama was over . phatik wipe his face , and sat down on the edg of a sunken barg on the river bank , and began to chew a piec of grass . a boat came up to the land , and a middle-ag man , with grey hair and dark moustach , step on shore . he saw the boy sit there doing noth , and ask him where the chakravorti live . phatik went on chew the grass , and said : `` over there , '' but it was quit imposs to tell where he point . the stranger ask him again . he swung his leg to and fro on the side of the barg , and said ; `` go and find out , '' and continu to chew the grass as before . but now a servant came down from the hous , and told phatik his mother want him . phatik refus to move . but the servant was the master on this occas . he took phatik up rough , and carri him , kick and struggl in impot rage . when phatik came into the hous , his mother saw him . she call out angrili : `` so you have been hit makhan again ? '' phatik answer indign : `` no , i have n't ; who told you that ? '' his mother shout : `` do n't tell lie ! you have . '' phatik said sudden : `` i tell you , i have n't . you ask makhan ! '' but makhan thought it best to stick to his previous statement . he said : '' yes , mother . phatik did hit me . '' phatik 's patienc was alreadi exhaust . he could not hear this injustic . he rush at makban , and hammer him with blow : `` take that '' he cri , `` and that , and that , for tell lie . '' his mother took makhan 's side in a moment , and pull phatik away , beat him with her hand . when phatik push her asid , she shout out : `` what i you littl villain ! would you hit your own mother ? '' it was just at this critic junctur that the grey-hair stranger arriv . he ask what was the matter . phatik look sheepish and asham . but when his mother step back and look at the stranger , her anger was chang to surpris . for she recognis her brother , and cri : '' why , dada ! where have you come from ? '' as she said these word , she bow to the ground and touch his feet . her brother had gone away soon after she had marri , and he had start busi in bombay . his sister had lost her husband while he was in bombay . bishamb had now come back to calcutta , and had at once made enquiri about his sister . he had then hasten to see her as soon as he found out where she was . the next few day were full of rejoic . the brother ask after the educ of the two boy . he was told by his sister that phatik was a perpetu nuisanc . he was lazi , disobedi , and wild . but makhan was as good as gold , as quiet as a lamb , and very fond of read , bishamb kind offer to take phatik off his sister 's hand , and educ him with his own children in calcutta . the widow mother readili agre . when his uncl ask phatik if he would like to go to calcutta with him , his joy knew no bound , and he said ; `` oh , yes , uncl ! '' in a way that made it quit clear that he meant it . it was an immens relief to the mother to get rid of phatik . she had a prejudic against the boy , and no love was lost between the two brother . she was in daili fear that he would either drown makhan some day in the river , or break his head in a fight , or run him into some danger or other . at the same time she was somewhat distress to see phatik 's extrem eager to get away . phatik , as soon as all was settl , kept ask his uncl everi minut when they were to start . he was on pin and needl all day long with excit , and lay awak most of the night . he bequeath to makhan , in perpetu , his fishing-rod , his big kite and his marbl . inde , at this time of departur his generos toward makhan was unbound . when they reach calcutta , phatik made the acquaint of his aunt for the first time . she was by no mean pleas with this unnecessari addit to her famili . she found her own three boy quit enough to manag without take any one els . and to bring a villag lad of fourteen into their midst was terribl upset . bishamb should realli have thought twice before commit such an indiscret . in this world of human affair there is no wors nuisanc than a boy at the age of fourteen . he is neither ornament , nor use . it is imposs to shower affect on him as on a littl boy ; and he is alway get in the way . if he talk with a childish lisp he is call a babi , and if he answer in a grown-up way he is call impertin . in fact any talk at all from him is resent . then he is at the unattract , grow age . he grow out of his cloth with indec hast ; his voic grow hoars and break and quaver ; his face grow sudden angular and unsight . it is easi to excus the shortcom of earli childhood , but it is hard to toler even unavoid laps in a boy of fourteen . the lad himself becom pain self-consci . when he talk with elder peopl he is either unduli forward , or els so unduli shi that he appear asham of his very exist . yet it is at this very age when in his heart of heart a young lad most crave for recognit and love ; and he becom the devot slave of any one who show him consider . but none dare open love him , for that would be regard as undu indulg , and therefor bad for the boy . so , what with scold and chide , he becom very much like a stray dog that has lost his master . for a boy of fourteen his own home is the only paradis . to live in a strang hous with strang peopl is littl short of tortur , while the height of bliss is to receiv the kind look of women , and never to be slight by them . it was anguish to phatik to be the unwelcom guest in his aunt 's hous , despis by this elder woman , and slight , on everi occas . if she ever ask him to do anyth for her , he would be so overjoy that he would overdo it ; and then she would tell him not to be so stupid , but to get on with his lesson . the cramp atmospher of neglect in his aunt 's hous oppress phatik so much that he felt that he could hard breath . he want to go out into the open countri and fill his lung and breath freeli . but there was no open countri to go to . surround on all side by calcutta hous and wall , he would dream night after night of his villag home , and long to be back there . he rememb the glorious meadow where he use to fli his kite all day long ; the broad river-bank where he would wander about the livelong day sing and shout for joy ; the narrow brook where he could go and dive and swim at any time he like . he thought of his band of boy companion over whom he was despot ; and , above all , the memori of that tyrant mother of his , who had such a prejudic against him , occupi him day and night . a kind of physic love like that of anim ; a long to be in the presenc of the one who is love ; an inexpress wist during absenc ; a silent cri of the inmost heart for the mother , like the low of a calf in the twilight ; -this love , which was almost an anim instinct , agit the shi , nervous , lean , uncouth and ugli boy . no one could understand it , but it prey upon his mind continu . there was no more backward boy in the whole school than phatik . he gape and remain silent when the teacher ask him a question , and like an overladen ass patient suffer all the blow that came down on his back . when other boy were out at play , he stood wist by the window and gaze at the roof of the distant hous . and if by chanc he espi children play on the open terrac of any roof , his heart would ach with long . one day he summon up all his courag , and ask his uncl : `` uncl , when can i go home ? '' his uncl answer ; `` wait till the holiday come . '' but the holiday would not come till novemb , and there was a long time still to wait . one day phatik lost his lesson-book . even with the help of book he had found it very difficult inde to prepar his lesson . now it was imposs . day after day the teacher would cane him unmerci . his condit becam so abject miser that even his cousin were asham to own him . they began to jeer and insult him more than the other boy . he went to his aunt at last , and told her that he had lost his book . his aunt purs her lip in contempt , and said : `` you great clumsi , countri lout . how can i afford , with all my famili , to buy you new book five time a month ? '' that night , on his way back from school , phatik had a bad headach with a fit of shiver . he felt he was go to have an attack of malari fever . his one great fear was that he would be a nuisanc to his aunt . the next morn phatik was nowher to be seen . all search in the neighbourhood prove futil . the rain had been pour in torrent all night , and those who went out in search of the boy got drench through to the skin . at last bisbamb ask help from the polic . at the end of the day a polic van stop at the door before the hous . it was still rain and the street were all flood . two constabl brought out phatik in their arm and place him before bishamb . he was wet through from head to foot , muddi all over , his face and eye flush red with fever , and his limb all trembl . bishamb carri him in his arm , and took him into the inner apart . when his wife saw him , she exclaim ; `` what a heap of troubl this boy has given us . had n't you better send him home ? '' phatik heard her word , and sob out loud : `` uncl , i was just go home ; but they drag me back again . '' the fever rose very high , and all that night the boy was deliri . bishamb brought in a doctor . phatik open his eye flush with fever , and look up to the ceil , and said vacant : `` uncl , have the holiday come yet ? may i go home ? '' bishamb wipe the tear from his own eye , and took phatik 's lean and burn hand in his own , and sat by him through the night . the boy began again to mutter . at last his voic becam excit : `` mother , '' he cri , `` do n't beat me like that ! mother ! i am tell the truth ! '' the next day phatik becam conscious for a short time . he turn his eye about the room , as if expect some one to come . at last , with an air of disappoint , his head sank back on the pillow . he turn his face to the wall with a deep sigh . bishamb knew his thought , and , bend down his head , whisper : '' phatik , i have sent for your mother . '' the day went by . the doctor said in a troubl voic that the boy 's condit was very critic . phatik began to cri out ; `` by the mark ! -- three fathom . by the mark -- four fathom . by the mark- . '' he had heard the sailor on the river-steam call out the mark on the plumb-lin . now he was himself plumb an unfathom sea . later in the day phatik 's mother burst into the room like a whirlwind , and began to toss from side to side and moan and cri in a loud voic . bishamb tri to calm her agit , but she flung herself on the bed , and cri : `` phatik , my darl , my darl . '' phatik stop his restless movement for a moment . his hand ceas beat up and down . he said : `` eh ? '' the mother cri again : `` phatik , my darl , my darl . '' phatik very slowli turn his head and , without see anybodi , said : '' mother , the holiday have come . '' my lord , the babi i raicharan was twelv year old when he came as a servant to his master hous . he belong to the same cast as his master , and was given his master 's littl son to nurs . as time went on the boy left raicharan arm to go to school . from school he went on to colleg , and after colleg he enter the judici servic . alway , until he marri , raicharan was his sole attend . but , when a mistress came into the hous , raicharan found two master instead of one . all his former influenc pass to the new mistress . this was compens for by a fresh arriv . anukul had a son born to him , and raicharan by his unspar attent soon got a complet hold over the child . he use to toss him up in his arm , call to him in absurd babi languag , put his face close to the babi 's and draw it away again with a grin . present the child was abl to crawl and cross the doorway . when raicharan went to catch him , he would scream with mischiev laughter and make for safeti . raicharan was amaz at the profound skill and exact judgment the babi show when pursu . he would say to his mistress with a look of awe and mysteri : `` your son will be a judg some day . '' new wonder came in their turn . when the babi began to toddl , that was to raicharan an epoch in human histori . when he call his father ba-ba and his mother ma-ma and raicharan chan-na , then raicharan 's ecstasi knew no bound . he went out to tell the news to all the world . after a while raicharan was ask to show his ingenu in other way . he had , for instanc , to play the part of a hors , hold the rein between his teeth and pranc with his feet . he had also to wrestl with his littl charg , and if he could not , by a wrestler 's trick , fall on his back defeat at the end , a great outcri was certain . about this time anukul was transfer to a district on the bank of the padma . on his way through calcutta he bought his son a littl go-cart . he bought him also a yellow satin waistcoat , a gold-lac cap , and some gold bracelet and anklet . raicharan was wont to take these out , and put them on his littl charg with ceremoni pride , whenev they went for a walk . then came the raini season , and day after day the rain pour down in torrent . the hungri river , like an enorm serpent , swallow down terrac , villag , cornfield , and cover with its flood the tall grass and wild casuarina on the sand-bank . from time to time there was a deep thud , as the river-bank crumbl . the unceas roar of the rain current could be beard from far away . mass of foam , carri swift past , prove to the eye the swift of the stream . one afternoon the rain clear . it was cloudi , but cool and bright . raicharan 's littl despot did not want to stay in on such a fine afternoon . his lordship climb into the go-cart . raicharan , between the shaft , drag him slowli along till he reach the rice-field on the bank of the river . there was no one in the field , and no boat on the stream . across the water , on the farther side , the cloud were rift in the west . the silent ceremoni of the set sun was reveal in all its glow splendour . in the midst of that still the child , all of a sudden , point with his finger in front of him and cri : `` chan-nal pitti fow . '' close by on a mud-flat stood a larg kadamba tree in full flower . my lord , the babi , look at it with greedi eye , and raicharan knew his mean . only a short time before he had made , out of these very flower ball , a small go-cart ; and the child had been so entir happi drag it about with a string , that for the whole day raicharan was not made to put on the rein at all . he was promot from a hors into a groom . but raicharan had no wish that even to go splash knee-deep through the mud to reach the flower . so he quick point his finger in the opposit direct , call out : `` oh , look , babi , look ! look at the bird . '' and with all sort of curious nois he push the go-cart rapid away from the tree . but a child , destin to be a judg , can not be put off so easili . and besid , there was at the time noth to attract his eye . and you can not keep up for ever the pretenc of an imaginari bird . the littl master 's mind was made up , and raicharan was at his wit end . `` very well , babi , '' he said at last , `` you sit still in the cart , and i ll go and get you the pretti flower . only mind you do n't go near the water . '' as he said this , he made his leg bare to the knee , and wade through the ooz mud toward the tree . the moment raicharan had gone , his littl master went off at race speed to the forbidden water . the babi saw the river rush by , splash and gurgl as it went . it seem as though the disobedi wavelet themselves were run away from some greater raicharan with the laughter of a thousand children . at the sight of their mischief , the heart of the human child grew excit and restless . he got down stealthili from the go-cart and toddl off toward the river . on his way he pick up a small stick , and leant over the bank of the stream pretend to fish . the mischiev fairi of the river with their mysteri voic seem invit him into their play-hous . raicharan had pluck a hand of flower from the tree , and was carri them back in the end of his cloth , with his face wreath in smile . but when he reach the go-cart , there was no one there . he look on all side and there was no one there . he look back at the cart and there was no one there . in that first terribl moment his blood froze within him . before his eye the whole univers swam round like a dark mist . from the depth of his broken heart he gave one pierc cri ; `` master , master , littl master . '' but no voic answer `` chan-na . '' no child laugh mischiev back ; no scream of babi delight welcom his return . only the river ran on , with its splash , gurgl nois as before , -- as though it knew noth at all , and had no time to attend to such a tini human event as the death of a child . as the even pass by raicharan 's mistress becam very anxious . she sent men out on all side to search . they went with lantern in their hand , and reach at last the bank of the padma . there they found raicharan rush up and down the field , like a stormi wind , shout the cri of despair : `` master , master , littl master ! '' when they got raicharan home at last , he fell prostrat at his mistress 's feet . they shook him , and question him , and ask him repeat where he had left the child ; but all he could say was , that he knew noth . though everi one held the opinion that the padma had swallow the child , there was a lurk doubt left in the mind . for a band of gipsi had been notic outsid the villag that afternoon , and some suspicion rest on them . the mother went so far in her wild grief as to think it possibl that raicharan himself had stolen the child . she call him asid with piteous entreati and said : `` raicharan , give me back my babi . oh ! give me back my child . take from me any money you ask , but give me back my child ! '' raicharan only beat his forehead in repli . his mistress order him out of the hous . artukul tri to reason his wife out of this wholli unjust suspicion : '' why on earth , '' he said , `` should he commit such a crime as that ? '' the mother only repli : `` the babi had gold ornament on his bodi . who know ? '' it was imposs to reason with her after that . ii raicharan went back to his own villag . up to this time he had had no son , and there was no hope that any child would now be born to him . but it came about before the end of a year that his wife gave birth to a son and die . all overwhelm resent at first grew up in raicharan 's heart at the sight of this new babi . at the back of his mind was resent suspicion that it had come as a usurp in place of the littl master . he also thought it would be a grave offenc to be happi with a son of his own after what had happen to his master 's littl child . inde , if it had not been for a widow sister , who mother the new babi , it would not have live long . but a chang gradual came over raicharan 's mind . a wonder thing happen . this new babi in turn began to crawl about , and cross the doorway with mischief in its face . it also show an amus clever in make its escap to safeti . its voic , its sound of laughter and tear , its gestur , were those of the littl master . on some day , when raicharan listen to its cri , his heart sudden began thump wild against his rib , and it seem to him that his former littl master was cri somewher in the unknown land of death because he had lost his chan-na . phailna ( for that was the name raicharan 's sister gave to the new babi ) soon began to talk . it learnt to say ba-ba and ma-ma with a babi accent . when raicharan heard those familiar sound the mysteri sudden becam clear . the littl master could not cast off the spell of his chan-na , and therefor he had been reborn in his own hous . the argument in favour of this were , to raicharan , altogeth beyond disput : ( i . ) the new babi was born soon after his littl master 's death . ( ii . ) his wife could never have accumul such merit as to give birth to a son in middl age . ( iii . ) the new babi walk with a toddl and call out ba-ba and ma-ma . there was no sign lack which mark out the futur judg . then sudden raicharan rememb that terribl accus of the mother . `` ah , '' he said to himself with amaz , `` the mother 's heart was right . she knew i had stolen her child . '' when once he had come to this conclus , he was fill with remors for his past neglect . he now gave himself over , bodi and soul , to the new babi , and becam its devot attend . he began to bring it up , as if it were the son of a rich man . he bought a go-cart , a yellow satin waistcoat , and a gold-embroid cap . he melt down the ornament of his dead wife , and made gold bangl and anklet . he refus to let the littl child play with any one of the neighbourhood , and becam himself its sole companion day and night . as the babi grew up to boyhood , he was so pet and spoilt and clad in such fineri that the villag children would call him `` your lordship , '' and jeer at him ; and older peopl regard raicharan as unaccount crazi about the child . at last the time came for the boy to go to school . raicharan sold his small piec of land , and went to calcutta . there he got employ with great difficulti as a servant , and sent phailna to school . he spare no pain to give him the best educ , the best cloth , the best food . meanwhil he live himself on a mere hand of rice , and would say in secret : `` ah ! my littl master , my dear littl master , you love me so much that you came back to my hous . you shall never suffer from any neglect of mine . '' twelv year pass away in this manner . the boy was abl to read and write well . he was bright and healthi and good-look . he paid a great deal of attent to his person appear , and was special care in part his hair . he was inclin to extravag and fineri , and spent money freeli . he could never quit look on raicharan as a father , because , though father in affect , he had the manner of a servant . a further fault was this , that raicharan kept secret from everi one that himself was the father of the child . the student of the hostel , where phailna was a boarder , were great amus by raicharan 's countri manner , and i have to confess that behind his father 's back phailna join in their fun . but , in the bottom of their heart , all the student love the innoc and tender-heart old man , and phailna was very fond of him also . but , as i have said before , he love him with a kind of condescens . raicharan grew older and older , and his employ was continu find fault with him for his incompet work . he had been starv himself for the boy 's sake . so he had grown physic weak , and no longer up to his work . he would forget thing , and his mind becam dull and stupid . but his employ expect a full servant 's work out of him , and would not brook excus . the money that raicharan had brought with him from the sale of his land was exhaust . the boy was continu grumbl about his cloth , and ask for more money . raicharan made up his mind . he gave up the situat where he was work as a servant , and left some money with phailna and said : `` i have some busi to do at home in my villag , and shall be back soon . '' he went off at once to baraset where anukul was magistr . anukul wife was still broken down with grief . she had had no other child . one day anukul was rest after a long and weari day in court . his wife was buy , at an exorbit price , a herb from a mendic quack , which was said to ensur the birth of a child . a voic of greet was heard in the courtyard . anukul went out to see who was there . it was raicharan . anukul 's heart was soften when he saw his old servant . he ask him mani question , and offer to take him back into servic . raicharan smile faint , and said in repli ; `` i want to make obeis to my mistress . '' anukul went with raicharan into the hous , where the mistress did not receiv him as warm as his old master . raicharan took no notic of this , but fold his hand , and said : `` it was not the padma that stole your babi . it was i . '' anukul exclaim : `` great god ! eh ! what ! where is he ? '' raicharan repli : '' he is with me , i will bring him the day after to-morrow . '' it was sunday . there was no magistr 's court sit . both husband and wife were look expect along the road , wait from earli morn for raicharan 's appear . at ten o'clock he came , lead phailna by the hand . anukul 's wife , without a question , took the boy into her lap , and was wild with excit , sometim laugh , sometim weep , touch him , kiss his hair and his forehead , and gaze into his face with hungri , eager eye . the boy was very good-look and dress like a gentleman 's son . the heart of anukul brim over with a sudden rush of affect . nevertheless the magistr in him ask : `` have you any proof ? '' raicharan said : `` how could there be any proof of such a deed ? god alon know that i stole your boy , and no one els in the world . '' when anukul saw how eager his wife was cling to the boy , he realis the futil of ask for proof . it would be wiser to believ . and then -- where could an old man like raicharan get such a boy from ? and why should his faith servant deceiv him for noth ? `` but , '' he ad sever , `` raicharan , you must not stay here . '' `` where shall i go , master ? '' said raicharan , in a choke voic , fold his hand ; `` i am old . who will take in an old man as a servant ? '' the mistress said : `` let him stay . my child will be pleas . i forgiv him . '' but anukul 's magisteri conscienc would not allow him . `` no , '' he said , '' he can not be forgiven for what he has done . '' raicharan bow to the ground , and clasp anukul 's feet . `` master , '' he cri , `` let me stay . it was not i who did it . it was god . '' anukul 's conscienc was wors stricken than ever , when raicharan tri to put the blame on god 's shoulder . `` no , '' he said , `` i could not allow it . i can not trust you any more . you have done an act of treacheri . '' raicharan rose to his feet and said : `` it was not i who did it . '' `` who was it then ? '' ask anukul . raicharan repli : `` it was my fate . '' but no educ man could take this for an excus . anukul remain obdur . when phailna saw that he was the wealthi magistr 's son , and not raicharan 's , he was angri at first , think that he had been cheat all this time of his birthright . but see raicharan in distress , he generous said to his father : `` father , forgiv him . even if you don't let him live with us , let him have a small month pension . '' after hear this , raicharan did not utter anoth word . he look for the last time on the face of his son ; he made obeis to his old master and mistress . then he went out , and was mingl with the numberless peopl of the world . at the end of the month anukul sent him some money to his villag . but the money came back . there was no one there of the name of raicharan . the kingdom of card i once upon a time there was a lone island in a distant sea where live the king and queen , the ace and the knave , in the kingdom of card . the ten and nine , with the twos and three , and all the other member , had long ago settl there also . but these were not twice-born peopl , like the famous court card . the ace , the king , and the knave were the three highest cast . the fourth cast was made up of a mixtur of the lower card . the twos and three were lowest of all . these inferior card were never allow to sit in the same row with the great court card . wonder inde were the regul and rule of that island kingdom . the particular rank of each individu had been settl from time immemori . everi one had his own appoint work , and never did anyth els . an unseen hand appear to be direct them wherev they went , -- accord to the rule . no one in the kingdom of card had any occas to think : no one had any need to come to any decis : no one was ever requir to debat any new subject . the citizen all move along in a listless groov without speech . when they fell , they made no nois . they lay down on their back , and gaze upward at the sky with each prim featur firm fix for ever . there was a remark still in the kingdom of card . satisfact and content were complet in all their round whole . there was never any uproar or violenc . there was never any excit or enthusiasm . the great ocean , croon its lullabi with one unceas melodi , lap the island to sleep with a thousand soft touch of its wave 's white hand . the vast sky , like the outspread azur wing of the brood mother-bird , nestl the island round with its downi plume . for on the distant horizon a deep blue line betoken anoth shore . but no sound of quarrel or strife could reach the island of card , to break its calm repos . ii in that far-off foreign land across the sea , there live a young princ whose mother was a sorrow queen . this queen had fallen from favour , and was live with her only son on the seashor . the princ pass his childhood alon and forlorn , sit by his forlorn mother , weav the net of his big desir . he long to go in search of the fli hors , the jewel in the cobra 's hood , the rose of heaven , the magic road , or to find where the princess beauti was sleep in the ogr 's castl over the thirteen river and across the seven sea . from the son of the merchant at school the young princ learnt the stori of foreign kingdom . from the son of the kotwal he learnt the adventur of the two genii of the lamp . and when the rain came beat down , and the cloud cover the sky , he would sit on the threshold face the sea , and say to his sorrow mother : `` tell me , mother , a stori of some very far-off land . '' and his mother would tell him an endless tale she had heard in her childhood of a wonder countri beyond the sea where dwelt the princess beauti . and the heart of the young princ would becom sick with long , as he sat on the threshold , look out on the ocean , listen to his mother 's wonder stori , while the rain outsid came beat down and the grey cloud cover the sky . one day the son of the merchant came to the princ , and said bold : '' comrad , my studi are over . i am now set out on my travel to seek my fortun on the sea . i have come to bid you good-by . '' the princ said ; `` i will go with you . '' and the son of kotwal said also : `` comrad , trusti and true , you will not leav me behind . i also will be your companion . '' then the young princ said to his sorrow mother ; `` mother , i am now set out on my travel to seek my fortun . when i come back once more , i shall sure have found some way to remov all your sorrow . '' so the three companion set out on their travel togeth . in the harbour were anchor the twelv ship of the merchant , and the three companion got on board . the south wind was blow , and the twelv ship sail away , as fast as the desir which rose in the princ breast . at the conch shell island they fill one ship with conch . at the sandal wood island they fill a second ship with sandal-wood , and at the coral island they fill a third ship with coral . four year pass away , and they fill four more ship , one with ivori , one with musk , one with clove , and one with nutmeg . but when these ship were all load a terribl tempest aros . the ship were all of them sunk , with their clove and nutmeg , and musk and ivori , and coral and sandal-wood and conch . but the ship with the three companion struck on an island reef , buri them safe ashor , and itself broke in piec . this was the famous island of card , where live the ace and king and queen and knave , with the nine and ten and all the other member -- accord to the rule . iii up till now there had been noth to disturb that island still . no new thing had ever happen . no discuss had ever been held . and then , of a sudden , the three companion appear , thrown up by the sea , -- and the great debat began . there were three main point of disput . first , to what cast should these unclass stranger belong ? should they rank with the court card ? or were they mere lower-cast peopl , to be rank with the nine and ten ? no preced could be quot to decid this weighti question . second , what was their clan ? had they the fairer hue and bright complexion of the heart , or was theirs the darker complexion of the club ? over this question there were intermin disput . the whole marriag system of the island , with its intric regul , would depend on its nice adjust . third , what food should they take ? with whom should they live and sleep ? and should their head be place south-west , north-west , or only north-east ? in all the kingdom of card a seri of problem so vital and critic had never been debat before . but the three companion grew desper hungri . they had to get food in some way or other . so while this debat went on , with its intermin silenc and paus , and while the ace call their own meet , and form themselves into a committe , to find some obsolet deal with the question , the three companion themselves were eat all they could find , and drink out of everi vessel , and break all regul . even the twos and three were shock at this outrag behaviour . the three said ; `` brother twos , these peopl are open shameless ! '' and the twos said : `` brother three , they are evid of lower cast than ourselves ! '' after their meal was over , the three companion went for a stroll in the citi . when they saw the ponder peopl move in their dismal process with prim and solemn face , then the princ turn to the son of the merchant and the son of the kotwal , and threw back his head , and gave one stupend laugh . down royal street and across ace squar and along the knave embank ran the quiver of this strang , unheard-of laughter , the laughter that , amaz at itself , expir in the vast vacuum of silenc . the son of the kotwal and the son of the merchant were chill through to the bone by the ghost-lik still around them . they turn to the princ , and said : `` comrad , let us away . let us not stop for a moment in this aw land of ghost . '' but the princ said : `` comrad , these peopl resembl men , so i am go to find out , by shake them upsid down and outsid in , whether they have a singl drop of warm live blood left in their vein . '' iv the day pass one by one , and the placid exist of the island went on almost without a rippl . the three companion obey no rule nor regul . they never did anyth correct either in sit or stand or turn themselves round or lie on their back . on the contrari , wherev they saw these thing go on precis and exact accord to the rule , they gave way to inordin laughter . they remain unimpress altogeth by the etern graviti of those etern regul . one day the great court card came to the son of the kotwal and the son of the merchant and the princ . `` why , '' they ask slowli , `` are you not move accord to the rule ? '' the three companion answer : `` because that is our ichcha ( wish ) . '' the great court card with hollow , cavern voic , as if slowli awaken from an age-long dream , said togeth : `` ich-cha ! and pray who is ich-cha ? '' they could not understand who ichcha was then , but the whole island was to understand it by-and-bi . the first glimmer of light pass the threshold of their mind when they found out , through watch the action of the princ , that they might move in a straight line in an opposit direct from the one in which they had alway gone before . then they made anoth startl discoveri , that there was anoth side to the card which they had never yet notic with attent . this was the begin of the chang . now that the chang had begun , the three companion were abl to initi them more and more deepli into the mysteri of ichcha . the card gradual becam awar that life was not bound by regul . they began to feel a secret satisfact in the king power of choos for themselves . but with this first impact of ichcha the whole pack of card began to totter slowli , and then tumbl down to the ground . the scene was like that of some huge python awak from a long sleep , as it slowli unfold its numberless coil with a quiver that run through its whole frame . v hitherto the queen of spade and club and diamond and heart had remain behind curtain with eye that gaze vacant into space , or els remain fix upon the ground . and now , all of a sudden , on an afternoon in spring the queen of heart from the balconi rais her dark eyebrow for a moment , and cast a singl glanc upon the princ from the corner of her eye . `` great god , '' cri the princ , `` i thought they were all paint imag . but i am wrong . they are women after all . '' then the young princ call to his side his two companion , and said in a medit voic ; `` my comrad ! there is a charm about these ladi that i never notic before . when i saw that glanc of the queen 's dark , lumin eye , brighten with new emot , it seem to me like the first faint streak of dawn in a newli creat world . '' the two companion smile a know smile , and said : `` is that realli so , princ ? '' and the poor queen of heart from that day went from bad to wors . she began to forget all rule in a truli scandal manner . if , for instanc , her place in the row was besid the knave , she sudden found herself quit accident stand besid the princ instead . at this , the knave , with motionless face and solemn voic , would say : `` queen , you have made a mistak . '' and the poor queen of heart ' red cheek would get redder than ever . but the princ would come gallant to her rescu and say : `` no ! there is no mistak . from to-day i am go to be knave ! '' now it came to pass that , while everi one was tri to correct the improprieti of the guilti queen of heart , they began to make mistak themselves . the ace found themselves elbow out by the king . the king got muddl up with the knave . the nine and ten assum air as though they belong to the great court card . the twos and three were found secret take the place special resent for the four and five . confus had never been so confound before . mani spring season had come and gone in that island of card . the kokil , the bird of spring , had sung its song year after year . but it had never stir the blood as it stir it now . in day gone by the sea had sung its tireless melodi . but , then , it had proclaim only the inflex monotoni of the rule . and sudden its wave were tell , through all their flash light and lumin shade and myriad voic , the deepest yearn of the heart of love ! vi where are vanish now their prim , round , regular , complac featur ? here is a face full of love-sick long . here is a heart heat wild with regret . here is a mind rack sore with doubt . music and sigh , and smile and tear , are fill the air . life is throb ; heart are break ; passion are kindl . everi one is now think of his own appear , and compar himself with other . the ace of club is muse to himself , that the king of spade may be just passabl good-look . `` but , '' say he , `` when i walk down the street you have only to see how peopl 's eye turn toward me . '' the king of spade is say ; `` why on earth is that ace of club alway strain his neck and strut about like a peacock ? he imagin all the queen are die of love for him , while the real fact is -- '' here he paus , and examin his face in the glass . but the queen were the worst of all . they began to spend all their time in dress themselves up to the nine . and the nine would becom their hopeless and abject slave . but their cut remark about one anoth were more shock still . so the young men would sit listless on the leav under the tree , loll with outstretch limb in the forest shade . and the young maiden , dress in pale-blu robe , would come walk accident to the same shade of the same forest by the same tree , and turn their eye as though they saw no one there , and look as though they came out to see noth at all . and then one young man more forward than the rest in a fit of mad would dare to go near to a maiden in blue . but , as he drew near , speech would forsak him . he would stand there tongue-ti and foolish , and the favour moment would pass . the kokil bird were sing in the bough overhead . the mischiev south wind was blow ; it disarray the hair , it whisper in the ear , and stir the music in the blood . the leav of the tree were murmur with rustl delight . and the ceaseless sound of the ocean made all the mute long of the heart of man and maid surg backward and forward on the full springtid of love . the three companion had brought into the dried-up channel of the kingdom of card the full flood-tid of a new life . vii and , though the tide was full , there-wa a paus as though the rise water would not break into foam but remain suspend for ever . there were no outspoken word , only a cautious go forward one step and reced two . all seem busi heap up their unfulfil desir like castl in the air , or fortress of sand . they were pale and speechless , their eye were burn , their lip trembl with unspoken secret . the princ saw what was wrong . he summon everi one on the island and said : `` bring hither the flute and the cymbal , the pipe and drum . let all be play togeth , and rais loud shout of rejoic . for the queen of heart this very night is go to choos her mate ! '' so the ten and nine began to blow on their flute and pipe ; the eight and seven play on their sackbut and viol ; and even the twos and three began to beat mad on their drum . when this tumult gust of music came , it swept away at one blast all those sigh and mope . and then what a torrent of laughter and word pour forth ! there were dare propos and lock refus , and gossip and chatter , and jest and merriment . it was like the sway and shake , and rustl and sough , in a summer gale , of a million leav and branch in the depth of the primev forest . but the queen of heart , in a rose-r robe , sat silent in the shadow of her secret bower , and listen to the great uproari sound of music and mirth , that came float toward her . she shut her eye , and dreamt her dream of lore . and when she open them she found the princ seat on the ground before her gaze up at her face . and she cover her eye with both hand , and shrank back quiver with an inward tumult of joy . and the princ pass the whole day alon , walk by the side of the surg sea . he carri in his mind that startl look , that shrink gestur of the queen , and his heart beat high with hope . that night the serri , gaily-dress rank of young men and maiden wait with smile face at the palac gate . the palac hall was light with fairi lamp and festoon with the flower of spring . slowli the queen of heart enter , and the whole assembl rose to greet her . with a jasmin garland in her hand , she stood before the princ with downcast eye . in her lowli bash she could hard rais the garland to the neck of the mate she had chosen . but the princ bow his head , and the garland slip to its place . the assembl of youth and maiden had wait her choic with eager , expect hush . and when the choic was made , the whole vast concours rock and sway with a tumult of wild delight . and the sound of their shout was heard in everi part of the island , and by ship far out at sea . never had such a shout been rais in the kingdom of card before . and they carri the princ and his bride , and seat them on the throne , and crown them then and there in the ancient island of card . and the sorrow mother queen , on the far-off island shore on the other side of the sea , came sail to her son 's new kingdom in a ship adorn with gold . and the citizen are no longer regul accord to the rule , but are good or bad , or both , accord to their ichcha . the devote at a time , when my unpopular with a part of my reader had reach the nadir of its glori , and my name had becom the central orb of the journal , to be attend through space with a perpetu rotat of revil , i felt the necess to retir to some quiet place and endeavour to forget my own exist . i have a hous in the countri some mile away from calcutta , where i can remain unknown and unmolest . the villag there have not , as yet , come to any conclus about me . they know i am no mere holiday-mak or pleasure-seek ; for i never outrag the silenc of the villag night with the riotous nois of the citi . nor do they regard me as ascet , because the littl acquaint they have of me carri the savour of comfort about it . i am not , to them , a travel ; for , though i am a vagabond by natur , my wander through the villag field is aimless . they are hard even quit certain whether i am marri or singl ; for they have never seen me with my children . so , not being abl to classifi me in any anim or veget kingdom that they know , they have long sinc given me up and left me stolid alon . but quit late i have come to know that there is one person in the villag who is deepli interest in me . our acquaint began on a sultri afternoon in juli . there had been rain all the morn , and the air was still wet and heavi with mist , like eyelid when weep is over . i sat lazili watch a dappl cow graze on the high bank of the river . the afternoon sun was play on her glossi hide . the simpl beauti of this dress of light made me wonder idl at man 's deliber wast of money in set up tailor ' shop to depriv his own skin of its natur cloth . while i was thus watch and lazili muse , a woman of middl age came and prostrat herself before me , touch the ground with her forehead . she carri in her robe some bunch of flower , one of which she offer to me with fold hand . she said to me , as she offer it : '' this is an offer to my god . '' she went away . i was so taken aback as she utter these word , that i could hard catch a glimps of her before she was gone . the whole incid was entir simpl , but it left a deep impress on my mind ; and as i turn back once more to look at the cattl in the field , the zest of life in the cow , who was munch the lush grass with deep breath , while she whisk off the fli , appear to me fraught with mysteri . my reader may laugh at my foolish , but my heart was full of ador . i offer my worship to the pure joy of live , which is god 's own life . then , pluck a tender shoot from the mango tree , i fed the cow with it from my own hand , and as i did this i had the satisfact of having pleas my god . the next year when i return to the villag it was februari . the cold season still linger on . the morn sun came into my room , and i was grate for its warmth . i was write , when the servant came to tell me that a devote , of the vishnu cult , want to see me . i told him , in an absent way , to bring her upstair , and went on with my write . the devote came in , and bow to me , touch my feet . i found that she was the same woman whom i had met , for a brief moment , a year ago . i was abl now to examin her more close . she was past that age when one ask the question whether a woman is beauti or not . her statur was above the ordinari height , and she was strong built ; but her bodi was slight bent owe to her constant attitud of vener . her manner had noth shrink about it . the most remark of her featur were her two eye . they seem to have a penetr power which could make distanc near . with those two larg eye of hers , she seem to push me as she enter . `` what is this ? '' she ask . `` why have you brought me here before your throne , my god ? i use to see you among the tree ; and that was much better . that was the true place to meet you . '' she must have seen me walk in the garden without my see her . for the last few clay , howev , i had suffer from a cold , and had been prevent from go out . i had , perforc , to stay indoor and pay my homag to the even sky from my terrac . after a silent paus the devote said to me : `` o my god , give me some word of good . '' i was quit unprepar for this abrupt request , and answer her on the spur of the moment : `` good word i neither give nor receiv . i simpli open my eye and keep silenc , and then i can at once both hear and see , even when no sound is utter . now , while i am look at you , it is as good as listen to your voic . '' the devote becam quit excit as i spoke , and exclaim : `` god speak to me , not only with his mouth , but with his whole bodi . '' i said to her : `` when i am silent i can listen with my whole bodi . i have come away from calcutta here to listen to that sound . '' the devote said : `` yes , i know that , and therefor i have come here to sit by you . '' before take her leav , she again bow to me , and touch my feet . i could see that she was distress , because my feet were cover . she wish them to be bare . earli next morn i came out , and sat on my terrac on the roof . beyond the line of tree southward i could see the open countri chill and desol . i could watch the sun rise over the sugar-can in the east , beyond the clump of tree at the side of the villag . out of the deep shadow of those dark tree the villag road sudden appear . it stretch forward , wind its way to some distant villag on the horizon , till it was lost in the grey of the mist . that morn it was difficult to say whether the sun had risen or not . a white fog was still cling to the top of the tree . i saw the devote walk through the blur dawn , like a mist-wraith of the morn twilight . she was sing her chant to god , and sound her cymbal . the thick haze lift at last ; and the sun , like the kind grandsir of the villag , took his seat amid all the work that was go on in home and field . when i had just settl down at my writing-t , to appeas the hungri appetit of my editor in calcutta , there came a sound of footstep on the stair , and the devote , hum a tune to herself , enter , and bow before me . i lift my head from my paper . she said to me : `` my god , yesterday i took as sacr food what was left over from your meal . '' i was startl , and ask her how she could do that . `` oh , '' she said , `` i wait at your door in the even , while you were at dinner , and took some food from your plate when it was carri out . '' this was a surpris to me , for everi one in the villag knew that i had been to europ , and had eaten with european . i was a vegetarian , no doubt , but the sanctiti of my cook would not bear investig , and the orthodox regard my food as pollut . the devote , notic my sign of surpris , said : `` my god , why should i come to you at all , if i could not take your food ? '' i ask her what her own cast peopl would say . she told me she had alreadi spread the news far and wide all over the villag . the cast peopl had shaken their head , but agre that she must go her own way . i found out that the devote came from a good famili in the countri , and that her mother was well to-do , and desir to keep her daughter . but she prefer to be a mendic . i ask her how she made her live . she told me that her follow had given her a piec of land , and that she beg her food from door to door . she said to me : `` the food which i get by beg is divin . '' after i had thought over what she said , i understood her mean . when we get our food precari as alm , we rememb god the giver . but when we receiv our food regular at home , as a matter of cours , we are apt to regard it as ours by right . i had a great desir to ask her about her husband . but as she never mention him even indirect , i did not question her . i found out very soon that the devote had no respect at all for that part of the villag where the peopl of the higher cast live . `` they never give , '' she said , `` a singl farth to god 's servic ; and yet they have the largest share of god 's glebe . but the poor worship and starv . '' i ask her why she did not go and live among these godless peopl , and help them toward a better life . `` that , '' i said with some unction , '' would be the highest form of divin worship . '' i had heard sermon of this kind from time to time , and i am rather fond of copi them myself for the public benefit , when the chanc come . but the devote was not at all impress . she rais her big round eye , and look straight into mine , and said : '' you mean to say that because god is with the sinner , therefor when you do them any servic you do it to god ? is that so ? '' `` yes , '' i repli , `` that is my mean . '' `` of cours , '' she answer almost impati , `` of cours , god is with them : otherwis , how could they go on live at all ? but what is that to me ? my god is not there . my god can not be worship among them ; because i do not find him there . i seek him where i can find him . '' as she spoke , she made obeis to me . what she meant to say was realli this . a mere doctrin of god 's omnipres does not help us . that god is all-pervad , -- this truth may be a mere intang abstract , and therefor unreal to ourselves . where i can see him , there is his realiti in my soul . i need not explain that all the while she shower her devot on me she did it to me not as an individu . i was simpli a vehicl of her divin worship . it was not for me either to receiv it or to refus it : for it was not mine , but god 's . when the devote came again , she found me once more engag with my book and paper . `` what have you been doing , '' she said , with evid vexat , `` that my god should make you undertak such drudgeri ? whenev i come , i find you read and write . '' `` god keep his useless peopl busi , '' i answer ; `` otherwis they would be bound to get into mischief . they have to do all the least necessari thing in life . it keep them out of troubl . '' the devote told me that she could not bear the encumbr , with which , day by day , i was surround . if she want to see me , she was not allow by the servant to come straight upstair . if she want to touch my feet in worship , there were my sock alway in the way . and when she want to have a simpl talk with me , she found my mind lost in a wilder of letter . this time , before she left me , she fold her hand , and said : `` my god ! i felt your feet in my breast this morn . oh , how cool ! and they were bare , not cover . i held them upon my head for a long time in worship . that fill my very being . then , after that , pray what was the use of my come to you yourself ? why did i come ? my lord , tell me truli , -- wasn't it a mere infatu ? '' there were some flower in my vase on the tabl . while she was there , the garden brought some new flower to put in their place . the devote saw him chang them . `` is that all ? '' she exclaim . `` have you done with the flower ? then give them to me . '' she held the flower tender in the cup of her hand , and began to gaze at them with bent head . after a few moment ' silenc she rais her head again , and said to me : `` you never look at these flower ; therefor they becom stale to you . if you would only look into them , then your read and write would go to the wind . '' she tie the flower togeth in the end of her robe , and place them , in an attitud of worship , on the top of her head , say rever : '' let me carri my god with me . '' while she did this , i felt that flower in our room do not receiv their due meed of love care at our hand . when we stick them in vase , they are more like a row of naughti schoolboy stand on a form to be punish . the devote came again the same even , and sat by my feet on the terrac of the roof . `` i gave away those flower , '' she said , `` as i went from hous to hous this morn , sing god 's name . beni , the head man of our villag , laugh at me for my devot , and said : whi do you wast all this devot on him ? do n't you know he is revil up and down the countrysid ? ' is that true , my god ? is it true that they are hard upon you ? '' for a moment i shrank into myself . it was a shock to find that the stain of printer ' ink could reach so far . the devote went on : `` beni imagin that he could blow out the flame of my devot at one breath ! but this is no mere tini flame : it is a burn fire . why do they abus you , my god ? '' i said : `` because i deserv it . i suppos in my greed i was loiter about to steal peopl 's heart in secret . '' the devote said : `` now you see for yourself how littl their heart are worth . they are full of poison , and this will cure you of your greed .

'' `` our merci god , '' she repli , `` beat us with his own hand , and drive away all the poison . he who endur god 's beat to the end is save . '' ii . that even the devote told me the stori of her life . the star of even rose and set behind the tree , as she went on to the end of her tale . `` my husband is very simpl . some peopl think that he is a simpleton ; but i know that those who understand simpli , understand truli . in busi and household manag he was abl to hold his own . because his need were small , and his want few , he could manag care on what we had . he would never meddl in other matter , nor tri to understand them . `` both my husband 's parent die before we had been marri long , and we were left alon . but my husband alway need some one to be over him . i am asham to confess that he had a sort of rever for me , and look upon me as his superior . but i am sure that he could understand thing better than i , though i had greater power of talk . `` of all the peopl in the world he held his guru thakur ( spiritu master ) in the highest vener . inde it was not vener mere but love ; and such love as his is rare . `` guru thakur was younger than my husband . oh ! how beauti he was ! `` my husband had play game with him when he was a boy ; and from that time forward he had dedic his heart and soul to this friend of his earli day . thakur knew how simpl my husband was , and use to teas him merciless . `` he and his comrad would play joke upon him for their own amus ; but he would bear them all with longsuff . `` when i marri into this famili , guru thakur was studi at benar . my husband use to pay all his expens . i was eighteen year old when he return home to our villag . `` at the age of fifteen i had my child . i was so young i did not know how to take care of him . i was fond of gossip , and like to be with my villag friend for hour togeth . i use to get quit cross with my boy when i was compel to stay at home and nurs him . ala ! my child-god came into my life , but his playth were not readi for him . he came to the mother 's heart , but the mother 's heart lag behind . he left me in anger ; and ever sinc i have been search for him up and down the world . `` the boy was the joy of his father 's life . my careless neglect use to pain my husband . but his was a mute soul . he has never been abl to give express to his pain . `` the wonder thing was this , that in spite of my neglect the child use to love me more than any one els . he seem to have the dread that i would one day go away and leav him . so even when i was with him , he would watch me with a restless look in his eye . he had me very littl to himself , and therefor his desir to be with me was alway pain eager . when i went each day to the river , he use to fret and stretch out his littl arm to be taken with me . but the bath ghal was my place for meet my friend , and i did not care to burden myself with the child . `` it was an earli morn in august . fold after fold of grey cloud had wrap the mid-day round with a wet cling robe . i ask the maid to take care of the boy , while i went down to the river . the child cri after me as i went away . `` there was no one there at the bath ghat when i arriv . as a swimmer , i was the best among all the villag women . the river was quit full with the rain . i swam out into the middl of the stream some distanc from the shore . `` then i heard a cri from the bank , mother ! ' i turn my head and saw my boy come down the step , call me as he came . i shout to him to stop , but he went on , laugh and call . my feet and hand becam cramp with fear . i shut my eye , afraid to see . when i open them , there , at the slipperi stair , my boy 's rippl of laughter had disappear for ever . `` i got back to the shore . i rais him from the water . i took him in my arm , my boy , my darl , who had beg so often in vain for me to take him . i took him now , but he no more look in my eye and call mother . ' `` my child-god had come . i had ever neglect him . i had ever made him cri . and now all that neglect began to beat against my own heart , blow upon blow , blow upon blow . when my boy was with me , i had left him alon . i had refus to take him with me . and now , when he is dead , his memori cling to me and never leav me . `` god alon know all that my husband suffer . if he had only punish me for my sin , it would have been better for us both . but he knew only how to endur in silenc , not how to speak . `` when i was almost mad with grief , guru thakur came back . in earlier day , the relat between him and my husband had been that of boyish friendship . now , my husband 's rever for his sanctiti and learn was unbound . he could hard speak in his presenc , his awe of him was so great . `` my husband ask his guru to tri to give me some consol . guru thakur began to read and explain to me the scriptur . but i do not think they had much effect on my mind . all their valu for me lay in the voic that utter them . god make the draught of divin life deepest in the heart for man to drink , through the human voic . he has no better vessel in his hand than that ; and he himself drink his divin draught out of the same vessel . `` my husband 's love and vener for his guru fill our hous , as incens fill a templ shrine . i show that vener , and had peac . i saw my god in the form of that guru . he use to come to take his meal at our hous everi morn . the first thought that would come to my mind on wake from sleep was that of his food as a sacr gift from god . when i prepar the thing for his meal , my finger would sing for joy . `` when my husband saw my devot to his guru , his respect for me great increas . he notic his guru 's eager desir to explain the scriptur to me . he use to think that he could never expect to earn any regard from his guru himself , on account of his stupid ; but his wife had made up for it . `` thus anoth five year went by happili , and my whole life would have pass like that ; but beneath the surfac some steal was go on somewher in secret . i could not detect it ; but it was detect by the god of my heart . then came a day when , in a moment our whole life was turn upsid down . `` it was a morn in midsumm . i was return home from bath , my cloth all wet , down a shadi lane . at the bend of the road , under the mango tree , i met my guru thakur . he had his towel on his shoulder and was repeat some sanskrit vers as he was go to take his bath . with my wet cloth cling all about me i was asham to meet him . i tri to pass by quick , and avoid being seen . he call me by my name . `` i stop , lower my eye , shrink into myself . he fix his gaze upon me , and said : how beauti is your bodi !

'' she touch the ground at my feet , rose and bow to me , and depart . vision i when i was a very young wife , i gave birth to a dead child , and came near to death myself . i recov strength very slowli , and my eyesight becam weaker and weaker . my husband at this time was studi medicin . he was not altogeth sorri to have a chanc of test his medic knowledg on me . so he began to treat my eye himself . my elder brother was read for his law examin . one day he came to see me , and was alarm at my condit . `` what are you doing ? '' he said to my husband . `` you are ruin kumo eye . you ought to consult a good doctor at once . '' my husband said irrit : `` why ! what can a good doctor do more than i am doing ? the case is quit a simpl one , and the remedi are all well known . '' dada answer with scorn : `` i suppos you think there is no differ between you and a professor in your own medic colleg . '' my husband repli angrili : `` if you ever get marri , and there is a disput about your wife 's properti , you wo n't take my advic about law . why , then , do you now come advis me about medicin ? '' while they were quarrel , i was say to myself that it was alway the poor grass that suffer most when two king went to war . here was a disput go on between these two , and i had to bear the brunt of it . it also seem to me very unfair that , when my famili had given me in marriag , they should interfer afterward . after all , my pleasur and pain are my husband 's concern , not theirs . from that day forward , mere over this trifl matter of my eye , the bond between my husband and dada was strain . to my surpris one afternoon , while my husband was away , dada brought a doctor in to see me . he examin my eye very care , and look grave . he said that further neglect would be danger . he wrote out a prescript , and dada for the medicin at once . when the strang doctor had gone , i implor my dada not to interfer . i was sure that only evil would come from the stealthi visit of a doctor . i was surpris at myself for pluck up courag speak to my brother like that . i had alway hitherto been afraid of him . i am sure also that dada was surpris at my bold . he kept silenc for a while , and then said to me : `` very well , kumo . i wo n't call in the doctor any more . but when the medicin come you must take it . '' dada then went away . the medicin came from chemist . i took it -- bottl , powder , prescript and all -- and threw it down the well ! my husband had been irrit by dada 's interfer , and he began to treat my eye with greater dilig than ever . he tri all sort of remedi . i bandag my eye as he told me , i wore his colour glass , i put in his drop , i took all his powder . i even drank the cod-liv oil he gave me , though my gorg rose against it . each time he came back from the hospit , he would ask me anxious how i felt ; and i would answer : `` oh ! much better . '' inde i becam an expert in self-delus . when i found that the water in my eye was still increas , i would consol myself with the thought that it was a good thing to get rid of so much bad fluid ; and , when the flow of water in my eye decreas , i was elat at my husband 's skill . but after a while the agoni becam unbear . my eyesight fade away , and i had continu headach day and night . i saw how much alarm my husband was get . i gather from his manner that he was cast about for a pretext to call in a doctor . so i hint that it might be as well to call one in . that he was great reliev , i could see . he call in an english doctor that very day . i do not know what talk they had togeth , but i gather that the sahib had spoken very sharpli to my husband . he remain silent for some time after the doctor had gone . i took his hand in mine , and said : `` what an ill-mann brute that was ! why did n't you call in an indian doctor ? that would have been much better . do you think that man know better than you do about my eye ? '' my husband was very silent for a moment , and then said with a broken voic : `` kumo , your eye must be oper on . '' i pretend to be vex with him for conceal the fact from me so long . `` here you have known this all the time , '' said i , `` and yet you have said noth about it ! do you think i am such a babi as to be afraid of an oper ? '' at that he regain his good spirit : `` there are very few men , '' said he , `` who are heroic enough to look forward to an oper without shrink . '' i laugh at him : `` yes , that is so . men are heroic only before their wive ! '' he look at me grave , and said : `` you are perfect right . we men are dread vain . '' i laugh away his serious : `` are you sure you can beat us women even in vaniti ? '' when dada came , i took him asid : `` dada , that treatment your doctor recommend would have done me a world of good ; only unfortun . i mistook the mixtur for the lotion . and sinc the day i made the mistak , my eye have grown steadili wors ; and now an oper is need . '' dada said to me : `` you were under your husband 's treatment , and that is why i gave up come to visit you . '' `` no , '' i answer . `` in realiti , i was secret treat myself in accord with your doctor 's direct . '' oh ! what lie we women have to tell ! when we are mother , we tell lie to pacifi our children ; and when we are wive , we tell lie to pacifi the father of our children . we are never free from this necess . my decept had the effect of bring about a better feel between my husband and dada . dada blame himself for ask me to keep a secret from my husband : and my husband regret that he had not taken my brother 's advic at the first . at last , with the consent of both , an english doctor came , and oper on my left eye . that eye , howev , was too weak to bear the strain ; and the last flicker glimmer of light went out . then the other eye gradual lost itself in dark . one day my husband came to my bedsid . `` i can not brazen it out before you any longer , '' said he , `` kumo , it is i who have ruin your eye . '' i felt that his voic was choke with tear , and so i took up his right hand in both of mine and said : `` why ! you did exact what was right . you have dealt only with that which was your very own . just imagin , if some strang doctor had come and taken away my eyesight . what consol should i have had then ? but now i can feel that all has happen for the best ; and my great comfort is to know that it is at your hand i have lost my eye . when ramchandra found one lotus too few with which to worship god , he offer both his eye in place of the lotus . and i hate dedic my eye to my god . from now , whenev you see someth that is a joy to you , then you must describ it to me ; and i will feed upon your word as a sacr gift left over from your vision . '' i do not mean , of cours , that i said all this there and then , for it is imposs to speak these thing an the spur of the moment . but i use to think over word like these for day and day togeth . and when i was very depress , or if at any time the light of my devot becam dim , and i piti my evil fate , then i made my mind utter these sentenc , one by one , as a child repeat a stori that is told . and so i could breath once more the seren air of peac and love . at the very time of our talk togeth , i said enough to show my husband what was in my heart . `` kumo , '' he said to me , `` the mischief i have done by my folli can never be made good . but i can do one thing . i can ever remain by your side , and tri to make up for your want of vision as much as is in my power . '' `` no , '' said i . `` that will never do . i shall not ask you to turn your hous into an hospit for the blind . there is only one thing to be done , you must marri again . '' as i tri to explain to him that this was necessari , my voic broke a littl . i cough , and tri to hide my emot , but he burst out say : '' kumo , i know i am a fool , and a braggart , and all that , but i am not a villain ! if ever i marri again , i swear to you -- i swear to you the most solemn oath by my famili god , gopinath -- may that most hate of all sin , the sin of parricid , fall on my head ! '' ah ! i should never , never have allow him to swear that dread oath . but tear were choke my voic , and i could not say a word for insuffer joy . i hid my blind face in my pillow , and sob , and sob again . at last , when the first flood of my tear was over , i drew his head down to my breast . `` ah ! '' said i , `` why did you take such a terribl oath ? do you think i ask you to marri again for your own sordid pleasur ? no ! i was think of myself , for she could perform those servic which were mine to give you when i had my sight . '' `` servic ! '' said he , `` servic ! those can be done by servant . do you think i am mad enough to bring a slave into my hous , and bid her share the throne with this my goddess ? '' as he said the word `` goddess , '' he held up my face in his hand , and place a kiss between my brow . at that moment the third eye of divin wisdom was open , where he kiss me , and verili i had a consecr . i said in my own mind : `` it is well . i am no longer abl to serv him in the lower world of household care . but i shall rise to a higher region . i shall bring down bless from above . no more lie ! no more decept for me ! all the littl and hypocrisi of my former life shall be banish for ever ! '' that day , the whole day through , i felt a conflict go on within me . the joy of the thought , that after this solemn oath it was imposs for my husband to marri again , fix its root deep in my heart , and i could not tear them out . but the new goddess , who had taken her new throne in me , said : `` the time might come when it would be good for your husband to break his oath and marri again . '' but the woman , who was within me , said : `` that may be ; but all the same an oath is an oath , and there is no way out . '' the goddess , who was within me , answer : `` that is no reason why you should exult over it . '' but the woman , who was within me , repli : `` what you say is quit true , no doubt ; all the same he has taken his oath . '' and the same stori went on again and again . at last the goddess frown in silenc , and the dark of a horribl fear came down upon me . my repent husband would not let the servant do my work ; he must do it all himself . at first it gave me unbound delight to be depend on him thus for everi littl thing . it was a mean of keep him by my side , and my desir to have him with me had becom intens sinc my blind . that share of his presenc , which my eye had lost , my other sens crave . when he was absent from my side , i would feel as if i were hang in mid-air , and had lost my hold of all thing tangibl . former , when my husband came back late from the hospit , i use to open my window and gaze at the road . that road was the link which connect his world with mine . now when i had lost that link through my blind , all my bodi would go out to seek him . the bridg that unit us had given way , and there was now this unsurpass chasm . when he left my side the gulf seem to yawn wide open . i could only wait for the time when he should cross back again from his own shore to mine . but such intens long and such utter depend can never be good . a wife is a burden enough to a man , in all conscienc , and to add to it the burden of this blind was to make his life unbear . i vow that i would suffer alon , and never wrap my husband round in the fold of my all-pervad dark . within an incred short space of time i manag to train myself to do all my household duti by the help of touch and sound and smell . in fact i soon found that i could get on with greater skill than before . for sight often distract rather than help us . and so it came to pass that , when these rove eye of mine could do their work no longer , all the other sens took up their sever duti with quietud and complet . when i had gain experi by constant practic , i would not let my husband do any more household duti for me . he complain bitter at first that i was depriv him of his penanc . this did not convinc me . whatev he might say , i could feel that he had a real sens of relief when these household duti were over . to serv daili a wife who is blind can never make up the life of a man . ii my husband at last had finish his medic cours . he went away from calcutta to a small town to practis as a doctor . there in the countri i felt with joy , through all my blind , that i was restor to the arm of my mother . i had left my villag birthplac for calcutta when i was eight year old . sinc then ten year had pass away , and in the great citi the memori of my villag home had grown dim . as long as i had eyesight , calcutta with its busi life screen from view the memori of my earli day . but when i lost my eyesight i knew for the first time that calcutta allur only the eye : it could not fill the mind . and now , in my blind , the scene of my childhood shone out once more , like star that appear one by one in the even sky at the end of the day . it was the begin of novemb when we left calcutta for harsingpur . the place was new to me , but the scent and sound of the countrysid press round and embrac me . the morn breez come fresh from the newli plough land , the sweet and tender smell of the flower mustard , the shepherd-boy 's flute sound in the distanc , even the creak nois of the bullock-cart , as it groan over the broken villag road , fill my world with delight . the memori of my past life , with all its ineff fragranc and sound , becam a live present to me , and my blind eye could not tell me i was wrong . i went back , and live over again my childhood . only one thing was absent : my mother was not with me . i could see my home with the larg peepul tree grow along the edg of the villag pool . i could pictur in my mind 's eye my old grandmoth seat on the ground with her thin wisp of hair unti , warm her back in the sun as she made the littl round lentil ball to be dri and use for cook . but somehow i could not recal the song she use to croon to herself in her weak and quaver voic . in the even , whenev i heard the low of cattl , i could almost watch the figur of my mother go round the shed with light lamp in her hand . the smell of the wet fodder and the pungent smoke of the straw fire would enter into my very heart . and in the distanc i seem to hear the clang of the templ bell waft up by the breez from the river bank . calcutta , with all its turmoil and gossip , curdl the heart . there , all the beauti duti of life lose their fresh and innoc . i rememb one day , when a friend of mine came in , and said to me : `` kumo , why do n't you feel angri ? if i had been treat like you by my husband , i would never look upon his face again . '' she tri to make me indign , because he had been so long call in a doctor . `` my blind , '' said i , `` was itself a suffici evil . why should i make it wors by allow hatr to grow up against my husband ? '' my friend shook her head in great contempt , when she heard such old-fashion talk from the lip of a mere chit of a girl . she went away in disdain . but whatev might be my answer at the time , such word as these left their poison ; and the venom was never wholli got out of the soul , when once they had been utter . so you see calcutta , with its never-end gossip , does harden the heart . but when i came back to the countri all my earlier hope and faith , all that i held true in life during childhood , becam fresh and bright once more . god came to me , and fill my heart and my world . i bow to him , and said : '' it is well that thou has taken away my eye . thou art with me . '' ah ! but i said more than was right . it was a presumpt to say : `` thou art with me . '' all we can say is this : `` i must be true to thee . '' even when noth is left for us , still we have to go on live . iii we pass a few happi month togeth . my husband gain some reput in his profess as a doctor . and money came with it . but there is a mischief in money . i can not point to any one event ; but , because the blind have keener percept than other peopl , i could discern the chang which came over my husband along with the increas of wealth . he had a keen sens of justic when he was younger , and had often told me of his great desir to help the poor when once he obtain a practic of his own . he had a nobl contempt far those in his profess who would not feel the puls of a poor patient before collect his fee . but now i notic a differ . he had becom strang hard . once when a poor woman came , and beg him , out of chariti , to save the life of her only child , he blunt refus . and when i implor him myself to help her , he did his work perfunctorili . while we were less rich my husband dislik sharp practic in money matter . he was scrupul honour in such thing . but sinc he had got a larg account at the bank he was often closet for hour with some scamp of a landlord 's agent , for purpos which clear bode no good . where has he drift ? what has becom of this husband of mine , -- the husband i knew before i was blind ; the husband who kiss me that day between my brow , and enshrin me on the throne of a goddess ? those whom a sudden gust of passion bring down to the dust can rise up again with a new strong impuls of good . but those who , day by day , becom dri up in the very fibr of their moral being ; those who by some outer parasit growth choke the inner life by slow degre , -- such wench one day a dead which know no heal . the separ caus by blind is the merest physic trifl . but , ah ! it suffoc me to find that he is no longer with me , where he stood with me in that hour when we both knew that i was blind . that is a separ inde ! i , with my love fresh and my faith unbroken , have kept to the shelter of my heart 's inner shrine . but my husband has left the cool shade of those thing that are ageless and unfad . he is fast disappear into the barren , waterless wast in his mad thirst for gold . sometim the suspicion come to me that thing not so bad as they seem : that perhap i exagger because i am blind . it may be that , if my eyesight were unimpair , i should have accept world as i found it . this , at any rate , was the light in which my husband look at all my mood and fanci . one day an old musalman came to the hous . he ask my husband to visit his littl grand-daught . i could hear the old man say : `` baba , i am a poor man ; but come with me , and allah will do you good . '' my husband answer cold : `` what allah will do wo n't help matter ; i want to know what you can do for me . '' when i heard it , i wonder in my mind why god had not made me deaf as well as blind . the old man heav a deep sigh , and depart . i sent my maid to fetch him to my room . i met him at the door of the inner apart , and put some money into his hand . `` pleas take this from me , '' said i , `` for your littl grand-daught , and get a trustworthi doctor to look after her . and-pray for my husband . '' but the whole of that day i could take no food at all . in the afternoon , when my husband got up from sleep , he ask me : `` why do you look so pale ? '' i was about to say , as i use to do in the past : `` oh ! it 's noth `` ; but those day of decept were over , and i spoke to him plain . `` i have been hesit , '' i said , `` for day togeth to tell you someth . it has been hard to think out what exact it was i want to say . even now i may not be abl to explain what i had in my mind . but i am sure you know what has happen . our live have drift apart . '' my husband laugh in a forc manner , and said : `` chang is the law of natur . '' i said to him : `` i know that . but there are some thing that are etern . '' then he becam serious . `` there are mani women , '' said he , `` who have a real caus for sorrow . there are some whose husband do not earn money . there are other whose husband do not love them . but you are make yourself wretch about noth at all . '' then it becam clear to me that my very blind had confer on me the power of see a world which is beyond all chang . yes ! it is true . i am not like other women . and my husband will never understand me . iv our two live went on with their dull routin for some time . then there was a break in the monotoni . an aunt of my husband came to pay us a visit . the first thing she blurt out after our first greet was this : '' well , krum , it 's a great piti you have becom blind ; but why do you impos your own afflict on your husband ? you must get him to anoth wife . '' there was an awkward paus . if my husband had only said someth in jest , or laugh in her face , all would have been over . but he stammer and hesit , and said at last in a nervous , stupid way : `` do you realli think so ? realli , aunt , you should n't talk like that . '' his aunt appeal to me . `` was i wrong , kumo ? '' i laugh a hollow laugh . `` had not you better , '' said i , `` consult some one more compet to decid ? the pickpocket never ask permiss from the man whose pocket he is go to pick . '' `` you are quit right , '' she repli bland . `` abinash , my dear , let us have our littl confer in privat . what do you say to that ? '' after a few day my husband ask her , in my presenc , if she knew of any girl of a decent famili who could come and help me in my household work . he knew quit well that i need no help . i kept silenc . `` oh ! there are heap of them , '' repli his aunt . `` my cousin has a daughter who is just of the marriag age , and as nice a girl as you could wish . her peopl would be only too glad to secur you as a husband . '' again there came from him that forc , hesit laugh , and he said : '' but i never mention marriag . '' `` how could you expect , '' ask his aunt , `` a girl of decent famili to come and live in your hous without marriag ? '' he had to admit that this was reason , and remain nervous silent . i stood alon within the close door of my blind after he had gone , and call upon my god and pray : `` o god , save my husband . '' when i was come out of the household shrine from my morn worship a few day later , his aunt took hold of both my hand warm . `` kumo , here is the girl , '' said she , `` we were speak about the other day . her name is hemangini . she will be delight to meet you . hemo , come here and be introduc to your sister . '' my husband enter the room at the same moment . he feign surpris when he saw the strang girl , and was about to retir . but his aunt said : '' abinash , my dear , what are you run away for ? there is no need to do that . here is my cousin 's daughter , hemangini , come to see you . hemo , make your bow to him . '' as if taken quit by surpris , he began to pli his aunt with question about the when and why and how of the new arriv . i saw the hollow of the whole thing , and took hemangini by the hand and led her to my own room . i gentl stroke her face and arm and hair , and found that she was about fifteen year old , and very beauti . as i felt her face , she sudden burst out laugh and said : `` why ! what are you doing ? are you hypnotis me ? '' that sweet ring laughter of hers swept away in a moment all the dark cloud that stood between us . i threw my right arm about her neck . `` dear one , '' said i , `` i am tri to see you . '' and again i stroke her soft face with my left hand . `` tri to see me ? '' she said , with a new burst of laughter . `` am i like a veget marrow , grown in your garden , that you want to feel me all round to see how soft i am ? '' i sudden bethought me that she did not know i had lost my sight . `` sister , i am blind , '' said i . she was silent . i could feel her big young eye , full of curios , peer into my face . i knew they were full of piti . then she grew thought and puzzl , and said , after a short paus : '' oh ! i see now . that was the reason your husband invit his aunt to come and stay here . '' `` no ! '' i repli , `` you are quit mistaken . he did not ask her to come . she came of her own accord . '' hemangini went off into a peal of laughter . `` that 's just like my aunt , '' said she . `` oh i was n't it nice of her to come without any invit ? but now she 's come , you wo n't get her to move for some time , i can assur you ! '' then she paus , and look puzzl . `` but why did father send me ? '' she ask . `` can you tell me that ? '' the aunt had come into the room while we were talk . hemangini said to her : `` when are you think of go back , aunt ? '' the aunt look very much upset . `` what a question to ask ! '' said she , `` i ve never seen such a restless bodi as you . we ve only just come , and you ask when we re go back ! '' `` it is all very well for you , '' hemangini said , `` for this hous belong to your near relat . but what about me ? i tell you plain i can't stop here . '' and then she held my hand and said : `` what do you think , dear ? '' i drew her to my heart , but said noth . the aunt was in a great difficulti . she felt the situat was get beyond her control ; so she propos that she and her niec should go out togeth to bath . `` no ! we two will go togeth , '' said hemangini , cling to me . the aunt gave in , fear opposit if she tri to drag her away . go down to the river hemangini ask me : `` why do n't you have children ? '' i was startl by her question , and answer : `` how can i tell ? my god has not given me any . that is the reason . '' `` no ! that 's not the reason , '' said hemangini quick . `` you must have commit some sin . look at my aunt . she is childless . it must be because her heart has some wicked . but what wicked is in your heart ? '' the word hurt me . i have no solut to offer for the problem of evil . i sigh deepli , and said in the silenc of my soul : `` my god ! thou knowest the reason . '' `` gracious good , '' cri hemangini , `` what are you sigh for ? no one ever take me serious . '' and her laughter peal across the river . v i found out after this that there were constant interrupt in my husband 's profession duti . he refus all call from a distanc , and would hurri away from his patient , even when they were close at hand . former it was only during the mid-day meal and at night-tim that he could come into the inner apart . but now , with unnecessari anxieti for his aunt 's comfort , he began to visit her at all hour of the day . i knew at once that he had come to her room , when i heard her shout for hemangini to bring in a glass of water . at first the girl would do what she was told ; but later on she refus altogeth . then the aunt would call , in an endear voic : `` hemo ! hemo ! hemangini . '' but the girl would cling to me with an impuls of piti . a sens of dread and sad would keep her silent . sometim she would shrink toward me like a hunt thing , who scarc knew what was come . about this time my brother came down from calcutta to visit me . i knew how keen his power of observ were , and what a hard judg he was . i fear my husband would be put on his defenc , and have to stand his trial before him . so i endeavour to hide the true situat behind a mask of noisi cheer . but i am afraid i overdid the part : it was unnatur for me . my husband began to fidget open , and ask how long my brother was go to stay . at last his impati becam littl short of insult , and my brother had no help for it but to leav . before go he place his hand on my head , and kept it there for some time . i notic that his hand shook , and a tear fell from his eye , as he silent gave me his bless . i well rememb that it was an even in april , and a market-day . peopl who had come into the town were go back home from market . there was the feel of an impend storm in the air ; the smell of the wet earth and the moistur in the wind were all-pervad . i never keep a light lamp in my bedroom , when i am alon , lest my cloth should catch fire , or some accid happen . i sat on the floor in my dark room , and call upon the god of my blind world . `` o my lord , '' i cri , `` thi face is hidden . i can not see . i am blind . i hold tight this broken rudder of a heart till my hand bleed . the wave have becom too strong for me . how long wilt thou tri me , my god , how long ? '' i kept my head prone upon the bedstead and began to sob . as i did so , i felt the bedstead move a littl . the next moment hemangini was by my side . she clung to my neck , and wipe my tear away silent . i do not know why she had been wait that even in the inner room , or why she had been lie alon there in the dusk . she ask me no question . she said no word . she simpli place her cool hand on my forehead , and kiss me , and depart . the next morn hemangini said to her aunt in my presenc : `` if you want to stay on , you can . but i do n't . i 'm go away home with our famili servant . '' the aunt said there was no need for her to go alon , for she was go away also . then smile and minc she brought out , from a plush case , a ring set with pearl . `` look , hemo , '' said she , `` what a beauti ring my abinash brought for you . '' hemangini snatch the ring from her hand . `` look , aunt , '' she answer quick , `` just see how splendid i aim . '' and she flung the ring into the tank outsid the window . the aunt , overwhelm with alarm , vexat , and surpris , bristl like a hedgehog . she turn to me , and held me by the hand . `` kumo , '' she repeat again and again , `` do n't say a word about this childish freak to abinash . he would be fear vex . '' i assur her that she need not fear . not a word would reach him about it from my lip . the next day before start for home hemangini embrac me , and said : '' dearest , keep me in mind ; do not forget me . '' i stroke her face over and over with my finger , and said : `` sister , the blind have long memori . '' i drew her head toward me , and kiss her hair and her forehead . my world sudden becam grey . all the beauti and laughter and tender youth , which had nestl so close to me , vanish when hemangini depart . i went grope about with arm outstretch , seek to find out what was left in my desert world . my husband came in later . he affect a great relief now that they were gone , but it was exagger and empti . he pretend that his aunt visit had kept him away from work . hitherto there had been only the one barrier of blind between me and my husband . now anoth barrier was ad , -- this deliber silenc about hemangini . he feign utter indiffer , but i knew he was having letter about her . it was earli in may . my maid enter my room one morn , and ask me : `` what is all this prepar go on at the land on the river ? where is master go ? '' i knew there was someth impend , but i said to the maid : `` i can't say . '' the maid did not dare to ask me any more question . she sigh , and went away . late that night my husband came to me . `` i have to visit a patient in the countri , '' said he . `` i shall have to start very earli to-morrow morn , and i may have to be away for two or three day . '' i got up from my bed . i stood before him , and cri aloud : `` why are you tell me lie ? '' my husband stammer out : `` what -- what lie have i told you ? '' i said : `` you are go to get marri . '' he remain silent . for some moment there was no sound in the room . then i broke the silenc : '' answer me , '' i cri . `` say , yes . '' he answer , `` yes , '' like a feebl echo . i shout out with a loud voic : `` no ! i shall never allow you . i shall save you from this great disast , this dread sin . if i fail in this , then why am i your wife , and why did i ever worship my god ? '' the room remain still as a stone . i drop on the floor , and clung to my husband 's knee . `` what have i done ? '' i ask . `` where have i been lack ? tell me truli . why do you want anoth wife ? '' my husband said slowli : `` i will tell you the truth . i am afraid of you . your blind has enclos you in its fortress , and i have now no entranc . to me you are no longer a woman . you are aw as my god . i can not live my everi day life with you . i want a woman -- just an ordinari woman -- whom i can be free to chide and coax and pet and scold . '' oh , tear open my heart and see ! what am i els but that , -- just an ordinari woman ? i am the same girl that i was when i was newli wed , a girl with all her need to believ , to confid , to worship . i do not recollect exact the word that i utter . i only rememb that i said : `` if i be a true wife , then , may god be my wit , you shall never do this wick deed , you shall never break your oath . before you commit such sacrileg , either i shall becom a widow , or hemangini shall die . '' then i fell down on the floor in a swoon . when i came to myself , it was still dark . the bird were silent . my husband had gone . all that day i sat at my worship in the sanctuari at the household shrine . in the even a fierc storm , with thunder and lightn and rain , swept down upon the hous and shook it . as i crouch before the shrine , i did not ask my god to save my husband from the storm , though he must have been at that time in peril on the river . i pray that whatev might happen to me , my husband might be save from this great sin . night pass . the whole of the next day i kept my seat at worship . when it was even there was the nois of shake and beat at the door . when the door was broken open , they found me lie unconsci on the ground , and carri me to my room . when i came to myself at last , i heard some one whisper in my ear : '' sister . '' i found that i was lie in my room with my head on hemangini 's lap . when my head move , i heard her dress rustl . it was the sound of bridal silk . o my god , my god ! my prayer has gone unheed ! my husband has fallen ! hemangini bent her head low , and said in a sweet whisper : `` sister , dearest , i have come to ask your bless on our marriag . '' at first my whole bodi stiffen like the trunk of a tree that has been struck by lightn . then i sat up , and said , pain , forc myself to speak the word : `` why should i not bless you ? you have done no wrong . '' hemangini laugh her merri laugh . `` wrong ! '' said she . `` when you marri it was right ; and when i marri , you call it wrong ! '' i tri to smile in answer to her laughter . i said in my mind : `` my prayer is not the final thing in this world . his will is all . let the blow descend upon my head ; but may they leav my faith and hope in god untouch . '' hemangini bow to me , and touch my feet . `` may you be happi , '' said i , bless her , `` and enjoy unbroken prosper . '' hemangini was still unsatisfi . `` dearest sister , '' she said , `` a bless for me is not enough . you must make our happi complet . you must , with those saint hand of yours , accept into your home my husband also . let me bring him to you . '' i said : `` yes , bring him to me . '' a few moment later i heard a familiar footstep , and the question , '' kumo , how are you ? '' i start up , and bow to the ground , and cri : `` dada ! '' hemangini burst out laugh . `` you still call him elder brother ? '' she ask . `` what nonsens ! call him younger brother now , and pull his ear and ceas him , for he has marri me , your younger sister . '' then i understood . my husband had been save from that great sin . he had not fallen . i knew my dada had determin never to marri . and , sinc my mother had die , there was no sacr wish of hers to implor him to wedlock . but i , his sister , by my sore need bad brought it to pass . he had marri for my sake . tear of joy gush from my eye , and pour down my cheek . i tri , but i could not stop them . dada slowli pass his finger through my hair . hemangini clung to me , and went on laugh . i was lie awak in my bed for the best part of the night , wait with strain anxieti for my husband 's return . i could not imagin how he would bear the shock of shame and disappoint . when it was long past the hour of midnight , slowli my door open . i sat up on my bed , and listen . they were the footstep of my husband . my heart began to beat wild . he came up to my bed , held my band in his . `` your dada , '' said he , `` has save me from destruct . i was being drag down and down by a moment mad . an infatu had seiz me , from which i seem unabl to escap . god alon know what a load i was carri on that day when i enter the boat . the storm came down on river , and cover the sky . in the midst of all fear i had a secret wish in my heart to be drown , and so disentangl my life from the knot which i had tie it . i reach mathurganj . there i heard the news which set me free . your brother had marri hemangini . i can not tell you with what joy and shame i heard it . i hasten on board the boat again . in that moment of self-revel i knew that i could have no happi except with you . you are a goddess . '' i laugh and cri at the same time , and said : `` no , no , no ! i am not go to be a goddess any longer i am simpli your own littl wife . i am an ordinari woman . '' `` dearest , '' he repli , `` i have also someth i want to say to you . never again put me to shame by call me your god . '' on the next day the littl town becam joyous with sound of conch shell . but nobodi made any refer to that night of mad , when all was so near lost . the babus of nayanjor i once upon a time the babus of nayanjor were famous landhold . they were note for their princ extravag . they would tear off the rough border of their dacca muslin , because it rub against their skin . they could spend mani thousand of rupe over the wed of a kitten . on a certain grand occas it is alleg that in order to turn night into day they light numberless lamp and shower silver thread from the sky to imit sunlight . those were the day before the flood . the flood came . the line of success among these old-world babus , with their lord habit , could not continu for long . like a lamp with too mani wick burn , the oil flare away quick , and the light went out . kaila babu , our neighbour , is the last relic of this extinct magnific . before he grew up , his famili had very near reach its lowest ebb . when his father die , there was one dazzl outburst of funer extravag , and then insolv . the properti was sold to liquid the debt . what littl readi money was left over was altogeth insuffici to keep up the past ancestr splendour . kaila babu left nayanjor , and came to calcutta . his son did not remain long in this world of fade glori . he die , leav behind him an only daughter . in calcutta we are kaila baba 's neighbour . curious enough our own famili histori is just the opposit to his . my father got his money by his own exert , and pride himself on never spend a penni more than was need . his cloth were those of a work man , and his hand also . he never had any inclin to earn the titl of baba by extravag display , and i myself his only son , owe him gratitud for that . he gave me the very best educ , and i was abl to make my way in the world . i am not asham of the fact that i am a self-mad man . crisp bank-not in my safe are dearer to me than a long pedigre in an empti famili chest . i believ this was why i dislik see kaila baba draw his heavi chequ on the public credit from the bankrupt bank of his ancient babu reput i use to fanci that he look down on me , because my father had earn money with his own hand . i ought to have notic that no one show any vexat toward kaila babu except myself . inde it would have been difficult to find an old man who did less harm than he . he was alway readi with his kind littl act of courtesi in time of sorrow and joy . he would join in all the ceremoni and religi observ of his neighbour . his familiar smile would greet young and old alik . his polit in ask detail about domest affair was untir . the friend who met him in the street were perforc readi to be button-hol , while a long string of question of this kind follow one anoth from his lip : '' my dear friend , i am delight to see you . are quit well ? how is shashi ? and dada -- is he all right ? do you know , i ve only just heard that madhu 's son has got fever . how is he ? have you heard ? and hari charan babu -- i ve not seen him for a long time -- i hope he is not ill. what 's the matter with rakkhal ? and , er -- er , how are the ladi of your famili ? '' kaila balm was spotless neat in his dress on all occas , though his suppli of cloth was sore limit . everi day he use to air his shirt and vest and coat and trouser care , and put them out in the sun , along with his bed-quilt , his pillowcas , and the small carpet on which he alway sat . after air them he would shake them , and brush them , and put them on the rock . his littl bit of furnitur made his small room decent , and hint that there was more in reserv if need . very often , for want of a servant , he would shut up his hous for a while . then he would iron out his shirt and linen with his own hand , and do other littl menial task . after this he would open his door and receiv his friend again . though kaila balm , as i have said , had lost all his land properti , he had still same famili heirloom left . there was a silver cruet for sprinkl scent water , a filigre box for otto-of-ros , a small gold salver , a cost ancient shawl , and the old-fashion ceremoni dress and ancestr turban . these he had rescu with the greatest difficulti from the money-lend ' clutch . on everi suitabl occas he would bring them out in state , and thus tri to save the world-fam digniti of the babus of nayanjor . at heart the most modest of men , in his daili speech he regard it as a sacr duti , owe to his rank , to give free play to his famili pride . his friend would encourag this trait in his charact with kind good-humour , and it gave them great amus . the neighbourhood soon learnt to call him their thakur dada ( grandfath ) . they would flock to his hous , and sit with him for hour togeth . to prevent his incur any expens , one or other of his friend would bring him tobacco , and say : `` thakur dada , this morn some tobacco was sent to me from gaya . do take it , and see how you like it . '' thakur dada would take it , and say it was excel . he would then go on to tell of a certain exquisit tobacco which they once smoke in the old day at nayanjor at the cost of a guinea an ounc . `` i wonder , '' he use to say , `` i wonder if any one would like to tri it now . i have some left , and can get it at once . '' everi one knew , that , if they ask for it , then somehow or other the key of the cupboard would be miss ; or els ganesh , his old famili servant , had put it away somewher . `` you never can be sure , '' he would add , `` where thing go to when servant are about . now , this ganesh of mine , -- i ca n't tell you what a fool he is , but i have n't the heart to dismiss him . '' ganesh , for the credit of the famili , was quit readi to bear all the blame without a word . one of the compani usual said at this point : `` never mind , thakur dada . pleas do n't troubl to look for it . this tobacco we re smoke will do quit well . the other would be too strong . '' then thakur dada would be reliev , and settl down again , and the talk would go on . when his guest got up to go away , thakur dada would accompani them to the door , and say to them on the door-step : `` oh , by the way , when are you all come to dine with me ? '' one or other of us would answer : `` not just yet , thakur dada , not just yet . we ll fix a day later . '' `` quit right , '' he would answer . `` quit right . we had much better wait till the rain come . it 's too hot now . and a grand rich dinner such as i should want to give you would upset us in weather like this . '' but when the rain did come , everi one care not to remind him of his promis . if the subject was brought up , some friend would suggest gentl that it was very inconveni to get about when the rain were so sever , that it would be much better to wait till they were over . and so the game went on . his poor lodg was much too small for his posit , and we use to condol with him about it . his friend would assur him they quit understood his difficulti : it was next to imposs to get a decent hous in calcutta . inde , they had all been look out for year for a hous to suit him , but , i need hard add , no friend had been foolish enough to find one . thakur dada use to say , after a long sigh of resign : `` well , well , i suppos i shall have to put up with this hous after all . '' then he would add with a genial smile : `` but , you know , i could never bear to be away from my friend . i must be near you . that realli compens for everyth . '' somehow i felt all this very deepli inde . i suppos the real reason was , that when a man is young stupid appear to him the worst of crime . kaila babu was not realli stupid . in ordinari busi matter everi one was readi to consult him . but with regard to nayanjor his utter were certain void of common sens . because , out of amus affect for him , no one contradict his imposs statement , he refus to keep them in bound . when peopl recount in his hear the glorious histori of nayanjor with absurd exagger he would accept all they said with the utmost graviti , and never doubt , even in his dream , that any one could disbeliev it . ii when i sit down and tri to analys the thought and feel that i had toward kaila babu i see that there was a still deeper reason for my dislik . i will now explain . though i am the son of a rich man , and might have wast time at colleg , my industri was such that i took my m.a . degre in calcutta univers when quit young . my moral charact was flawless . in addit , my outward appear was so handsom , that if i were to call myself beauti , it might be thought a mark of self-estim , but could not be consid an untruth . there could be no question that among the young men of bengal i was regard by parent general as a very elig match . i was myself quit clear on the point , and had determin to obtain my full valu in the marriag market . when i pictur my choic , i had before my mind eye a wealthi father 's only daughter , extrem beauti and high educ . propos came pour in to me from far and near ; larg sum in cash were offer . i weigh these offer with rigid imparti , in the delic scale of my own estim . but there was no one fit to be my partner . i becam convinc , with the poet bhabavuti , that in this world endless time and boundless space one may be born at last to match my sovereign grace . but in this puni modern age , and this contract space of modern bengal , it was doubt if the peerless creatur exist as yet . meanwhil my prais were sung in mani tune , and in differ metr , by design parent . whether i was pleas with their daughter or not , this worship which they offer was never unpleas . i use to regard it as my proper due , because i was so good . we are told that when the god withhold their boon from mortal they still expect their worshipp to pay them fervent honour , and are angri if it is withheld . i had that divin expect strong develop in myself . i have alreadi mention that thakur dada had an only grand-daught . i had seen her mani time , but had never mistaken her for beauti . no thought had ever enter my mind that she would be a possibl partner for myself . all the same , it seem quit certain to me that some day ox other kaila babu would offer her , with all due worship , as an oblat at my shrine . indeed-thi was the secret of my dislike-i was thorough annoy that he had not done it alreadi . i heard he had told his friend that the babus of nayanjor never crave a boon . even if the girl remain unmarri , he would not break the famili tradit . it was this arrog of his that made me angri . my indign smoulder for some time . but i remain perfect silent , and bore it with the utmost patienc , because i was so good . as lightn accompani thunder , so in my charact a flash of humour was mingl with the mutter of my wrath . it was , of cours , imposs for me to punish the old man mere to give vent to my rage ; and for a long time i did noth at all . but sudden one day such an amus plan came into my head , that i could not resist the temptat of carri it into effect . i have alreadi said that mani of kaila babu 's friend use to flatter the old man 's vaniti to the full . one , who was a retir govern servant , had told him that whenev he saw the chota lord sahib he alway ask for the latest news about the babus of nayanjor , and the chota lard had been heard to say that in all bengal the only realli respect famili were those of the maharaja of burdwan and the babus of nayanjor . when this monstrous falsehood was told to kaila balm he was extrem gratifi , and often repeat the stori . and wherev after that he met this govern servant in compani he would ask , along with other question : '' oh ! er -- by the way , how is the chota lord sahib ? quit well , did you say ? ah , yes , i am so delight to hear it i and the dear mem sahib , is she quit well too ? ah , yes ! and the littl children-ar they quit well also ? ah , yes i that 's very goad news ! be sure and give them my compliment when you see them . '' kaila balm would constant express his intent of go some day and pay a visit to the sahib . but it may be taken for grant that mani chota lord and burro lord also would come and go , and much water would pass down the hoog , before the famili coach of nayanjor would be furnish up to pay a visit to govern hous . one day i took kaila babu asid , and told him in a whisper : `` thakur dada , i was at the leve yesterday , and the chota lord happen to mention the babe of nayanjor . i told him that kaila balm had come to town . do you know , he was terribl hurt because you had n't call . he told me he was go to put etiquett on one side , and pay you a privat visit himself this very afternoon . '' anybodi els could have seen through this plot of mine in a moment . and , if it had been direct against anoth person , kaila balm would have understood the joke . but after all he had heard from his friend the govern servant , and after all his own exagger , a visit from the lieutenant-governor seem the most natur thing in the world . he becam high nervous and excit at my news . each detail of the come visit exercis him great -- most of all his own ignor of english . how on earth was that difficulti to be met ? i told him there was no difficulti at all : it was aristocrat not to know english : and , besid , the lieutenant-governor alway brought an interpret with him , and he had expressli mention that this visit was to be privat . about mid-day , when most of our neighbour are at work , and the rest are asleep , a carriag and pair stop before the lodg of kaila babu . two flunkey in liveri came up the stair , and announc in a loud voic , `` the chota lord sahib hoe arriv . '' kaila babu was readi , wait for him , in his old-fashion ceremoni robe and ancestr turban , and ganesh was by his side , dress in his master 's best suit of cloth for the occas . when the chota lord sahib was announc , kaila balm ran pant and puf and trembl to the door , and led in a friend of mine , in disguis , with repeat salaam , bow low at each step , and walk backward as best he could . he had his old famili shawl spread over a hard wooden chair , and he ask the lord sahib to be seat . he then made a high flown speech in urdu , the ancient court languag of the sahib , and present on the golden salver a string of gold mohur , the last relic of his broken fortun . the old famili servant ganesh , with an express of awe border on terror , stood behind with the scent-sprinkl , drench the lord sahib , touch him ginger from time to time with the otto-of-ros from the filigre box . kaila babu repeat express his regret at not being abl to receiv his honour bahadur with all the ancestr magnific of his own famili estat at nayanjor . there he could have welcom him proper with due ceremoni . but in calcutta he was a mere stranger and sojourner-in fact a fish out of water . my friend , with his tall silk hat on , very grave nod . i need hard say that accord to english custom the hat ought to have been remov insid the room . but my friend did not dare to take it off for fear of detect ; and kaila balm and his old servant ganesh were sublim unconsci of the breach of etiquett . after a ten minut ' interview , which consist chiefli of nod the head , my friend rose to his feet to depart . the two flunkey in liveri , as had been plan beforehand , carri off in state the string of gold mohur , the gold salver , the old ancestr shawl , the silver scent-sprinkl , and the otto-of-ros filigre box ; they place them ceremoni in the carriag . kaila babu regard this as the usual habit of chota lard sahib . i was watch all the while from the next room . my side were ach with suppress laughter . when i could hold myself in no longer , i rush into a further room , sudden to discov , in a corner , a young girl sob as if her heart would break . when she saw my uproari laughter she stood upright in passion , flash the lightn of her big dark eye in mine , and said with a tear-chok voic : '' tell me ! what harm has my grandfath done to you ? why have you come to deceiv him ? why have you come here ? why -- '' she could say no more . she cover her face with her hand , and broke into sob . my laughter vanish in a moment . it had never occur to me that there was anyth but a suprem funni joke in this act of mine , and here i discov that i had given the cruelest pain to this tenderest littl heart . all the ugli of my cruelti rose up to condemn me . i slunk out of the room in silenc , like a kick dog . hitherto i had only look upon kusum , the grand-daught of kaila babu , as a somewhat worthless commod in the marriag market , wait in vain to attract a husband . but now i found , with a shock of surpris , that in the corner of that room a human heart was beat . the whole night through i had very littl sleep . my mind was in a tumult . on the next day , very earli in the morn , i took all those stolen good back to kaila babe 's lodg , wish to hand them over in secret to the servant ganesh . i wait outsid the door , and , not find any one , went upstair to kaila babu 's room . i heard from the passag kusum ask her grandfath in the most win voic : `` dada , dearest , do tell me all that the chota lord sahib said to you yesterday . do n't leav out a singl word . i am die to hear it all over again . '' and dada need no encourag . his face beam over with pride as he relat all manner of prais , which the lard sahib had been good enough to utter concern the ancient famili of nayanjor . the girl was seat before him , look up into his face , and listen with rapt attent . she was determin , out of love for the old man , to play her part to the full . my heart was deepli touch , and tear came to my eye . i stood there in silenc in the passag , while thakur dada finish all his embellish of the chota lord sahib 's wonder visit . when he left the room at last , i took the stolen good and laid them at the feet of the girl and came away without a word . later in the day i call again to see kaila balm himself . accord to our ugli modern custom , i had been in the habit of make no greet at all to this old man when i came into the room . but on this day i made a low bow , and touch his feet . i am convinc the old man thought that the come of the chota lord sahib to his hous was the caus of my new polit . he was high gratifi by it , and an air of benign sever shone from his eye . his friend had flock in , and he had alreadi begun to tell again at full length the stori of the lieutenant-governor 's visit with still further adorn of a most fantast kind . the interview was alreadi becom an epic , both in qualiti and in length . when the other visitor had taken their leav , i made my propos to the old man in a humbl manner . i told him that , `` though i could never for a moment hope to be worthi of marriag connect with such an illustri famili , yet ... etc . etc . '' when i made clear my propos of marriag , the old man embrac me , and broke out in a tumult of joy : `` i am a poor man , and could never have expect such great good fortun . '' that was the first and last time in his life that kaila babu confess to being poor . it was also the first and last time in his life that he forgot , if only for a singl moment , the ancestr digniti that belong to the babus of nayanjor . live or dead ? i the widow in the hous of saradasankar , the ranihat zemindar , had no kinsmen of her father 's famili . one after anoth all had die . nor had she in her husband 's famili any one she could call her own , neither husband nor son . the child of her brother-in-law saradasankar was her darl . far a long time after his birth , his mother had been very ill , and the widow , his aunt kadambini , had foster him . if a woman foster anoth 's child , her love for him is all the stronger because she has no claim upon him-no claim of kinship , that is , but simpli the claim of love . love can not prove its claim by any document which societi accept , and does not wish to prove it ; it mere worship with doubl passion its life 's uncertain treasur . thus all the widow 's thwart love went out to ward this littl child . one night in sraban kadambini die sudden . for some reason her heart stop beat . everywher els the world held on its cours ; only in this gentl littl breast , suffer with love , the watch of time stood still for ever . lest they should be harass by the poik , four of the zemindar brahmin servant took away the bodi , without ceremoni , to be burn . the burning-ground of ranihat was very far from the villag . there was a hut besid a tank , a huge banian near it , and noth more . former a river , now complet dri up , ran through the ground , and part of the watercours had been dug out to make a tank for the perform of funer rite . the peopl consid the tank as part of the river and reverenc it as such . take the bodi into the hut , the four men sat down to wait for the wood . the time seem so long that two of the four grew restless , and went to see why it did not come . nitai and gurucharan being gone , bidhu and banamali remain to watch over the bodi . it was a dark night of sraban . heavi cloud hung in a starless sky . the two men sat silent in the dark room . their match and lamp were useless . the match were damp , and would not light , for all their effort , and the lantern went out . after a long silenc , one said : `` brother , it would be good if we had a bowl of tobacco . in our hurri we brought none . '' the other answer : `` i can run and bring all we want . '' understand why banarnali want to go ( from fear of ghost , the burning-ground being consid haunt . ) , bidhu said : `` i daresay ! meanwhil , i suppos i am to sit here alon ! '' convers ceas again . five minut seem like an hour . in their mind they curs the two , who had gone to fetch the wood , and they began to suspect that they sat gossip in some pleasant nook . there was no sound anywher , except the incess nois of frog and cricket from the tank . then sudden they fanci that the bed shook slight , as if the dead bodi had turn on its side . bidhu and banamali trembl , and began mutter : `` ram , ram . '' a deep sigh was heard in the room . in a moment the watcher leapt out of the hut , and race for the villag . after run about three mile , they met their colleagu come back with a lantern . as a matter of fact , they had gone to smoke , and knew noth about the wood . but they declar that a tree had been cut down , and that , when it was split up , it would be brought along at once . then bidhu and banamali told them what had happen in the hut . nitai and gurucharan scof at the stori , and abus bidhu and banamali angrili for leav their duti . without delay all four return to the hut . as they enter , they saw at once that the bodi was gone ; noth but an empti bed remain . they stare at one anoth . could a jackal have taken it ? but there was no scrap of cloth anywher . go outsid , they saw that on the mud that had collect at the door of the but there were a woman 's tini footprint , newli made . saradasankar was no fool , and they could hard persuad him to believ in this ghost stori . so after much discuss the four decid that it would be best to say that the bodi had been burnt . toward dawn , when the men with the wood arriv they were told that , owe to their delay , the work had been done without them ; there had been some wood in the but after all . no one was like to question this , sinc a dead bodi is not such a valuabl properti that any one would steal it . ii everi one know that , even when there is no sign , life is often secret present , and may begin again in an appar dead bodi . kadambini was not dead ; only the machin of her life had for some reason sudden stop . when conscious return , she saw dens dark on all side . it occur to her that she was not lie in her usual place . she call out `` sister , '' but no answer came from the dark . as she sat up , terror-stricken , she rememb her death-b , the sudden pain at her breast , the begin of a choke sensat . her elder sister-in-law was warm some milk for the child , when kadambini becam faint , and fell on the bed , say with a choke voic : `` sister , bring the child here . i am worri . '' after that everyth was black , as when an inkpot is upset over an exercise-book . kadambini 's memori and conscious , all the letter of the world 's book , in a moment becam formless . the widow could not rememb whether the child , in the sweet voic of love , call her `` aunti , '' as if for the last time , or not ; she could not rememb whether , as she left the world she knew for death 's endless unknown journey , she had receiv a part gift of affect , love passage-money for the silent land . at first , i fanci , she thought the lone dark place was the hous of yama , where there is noth to see , noth to hear , noth to do , only an etern watch . but when a cold damp wind drove through the open door , and she heard the croak of frog , she rememb vivid and in a moment all the rain of her short life , and could feel her kinship with the earth . then came a flash of lightn , and she saw the tank , the banian , the great plain , the far-off tree . she rememb how at full moon she had sometim come to bath in this tank , and how dread death had seem when she saw a corps on the burning-ground . her first thought was to return home . but then she reflect : `` i am dead . how can i return home ? that would bring disast on them . i have left the kingdom of the live ; i am my own ghost ! '' if this were not so , she reason , how could she have got out of saradasankar 's well-guard zenana , and come to this distant burningground at midnight ? also , if her funer rite had not been finish , where had the men gone who should burn her ? recal her death-moment in saradasankar 's brightly-lit hous , she now found herself alon in a distant , desert , dark burn . ground . sure she was no member of earth societi ! sure she was a creatur of horror , of ill-omen , her own ghost ! at this thought , all the bond were snap which bound her to the world . she felt that she had marvel strength , endless freedom . she could do what she like , go where she pleas . mad with the inspir of this new idea , she rush from the but like a gust of wind , and stood upon the burn ground . all trace of shame or fear had left her . but as she walk on and on , her feet grew tire , her bodi weak . the plain stretch on endless ; here and there were paddy-field ; sometim she found herself stand knee-deep in water . at the first glimmer of dawn she heard one or two bird cri from the bamboo-clump by the distant hous . then terror seiz her . she could not tell in what new relat she stood to the earth and to live folk . so long as she had been on the plain , on the burning-ground , cover by the dark night of sraban , so long she had been fearless , a denizen of her own kingdom . by daylight the home of men fill her with fear . men and ghost dread each other , for their tribe inhabit differ bank of the river of death . iii her cloth were clot in the mud ; strang thought and walk by night had given her the aspect of a madwoman ; truli , her apparit was such that folk might have been afraid of her , and children might have stone her or run away . luckili , the first to catch sight of her was a travel . he came up , and said : `` mother , you look a respect woman . wherev are you go , alon and in this guis ? '' kadambini , unabl to collect her thought , stare at him in silenc . she could not think that she was still in touch with the world , that she look like a respect woman , that a travel was ask her question . again the min said : `` come , mother , i will see you home . tell me where you live . '' kadambini thought . to return to her father-in-law 's hous would be absurd , and she had no father 's hous . then she rememb the friend of her childhood . she had not seen jogmaya sinc the day of her youth , but from time to time they had exchang letter . occasion there had been quarrel between them , as was only right , sinc kadambini wish to make it dear that her love for jogmaya was unbound , while her friend complain that kadambini did not return a love equal to her own . they were both sure that , if they once met , they would be insepar . kadambini said to the travel : `` i will go to sripati 's hous at nisindapur . '' as he was go to calcutta , nisindapur , though not near , was on his way . so he took kadambini to sripati s hous , and the friend met again . at first they did not recognis one anoth , but gradual each recognis the featur of the other 's childhood . `` what luck ! '' said jogmaya . `` i never dreamt that i should see you again . but how hate you come here , sister ? your father-in-law 's folk sure did n't let you go ! '' kadambini remain silent , and at last said : `` sister , do not ask about my father-in-law . give me a corner , and treat me as a servant : i will do your work . '' `` what ? '' cri jogmaya . `` keep you like a servant ! why , you are my closest friend , you are my -- '' and so on and so on . just then sripati came in . kadambini stare at him for some time , and then went out very slowli . she kept her head uncov , and show not the slightest modesti or respect . jogmaya , fear that sripati would be prejud against her friend , began an elabor explan . but sripati , who readili agre to anyth jogmaya said , cut short her stori , and left his wife uneasi in her mind . kadambini had come , but she was not at one with her friend : death was between them . she could feel no intimaci for other so long as her exist perplex her and conscious remain . kadambini would look at jogmaya , and brood . she would think : `` she has her husband and her work , she live in a world far away from mine . she share affect and duti with the peopl of the world ; i am an empti shadow . she is among the live ; i am in etern . '' jogmaya also was uneasi , but could not explain why . women do not love mysteri , because , though uncertainti may be transmut into poetri , into heroism , into scholarship , it can not be turn to account in household work . so , when a woman can not understand a thing , she either destroy and forget it , or she shape it anew for her own use ; if she fail to deal with it in one of these way , she lose her temper with it . the greater kadambini 's abstract becam , the more impati was jogmaya with her , wonder what troubl weigh upon her mind . then a new danger aros . kadambini was afraid of herself ; yet she could not flee from herself . those who fear ghost fear those who are behind them ; wherev they can not see there is fear . but kadambini 's chief terror lay in herself , for she dread noth extern . at the dead of night , when alon in her room , she scream ; in the even , when she saw her shadow in the lamp-light , her whole bodi shook . watch her fear , the rest of the hous fell into a sort of terror . the servant and jogmaya herself began to see ghost . one midnight , kadambini came out from her bedroom weep , and wail at jogmaya 's door : `` sister , sister , let me lie at your feet ! do not put me by myself ! '' jogmaya 's anger was no less than her fear . she would have like to drive kadambini from the hous that very second . the good-natur sripati , after much effort , succeed in quiet their guest , and put her in the next room . next day sripati was unexpect summon to his wife 's apart . she began to upbraid him : `` you , do you call yourself a man ? a woman run away from her father-in-law , and enter your hous ; a month pass , and you have n't hint that she should go away , nor have i heard the slightest protest from you . i should cake it as a favour if you would explain yourself . you men are all alik . '' men , as a race , have a natur partial for womankind in general , foe which women themselves hold them account . although sripati was prepar to touch jogmaya 's bodi , and swear that his kind feel toward the helpless but beauti kadambini was no whit greater than it should be , he could not prove it by his behaviour . he thought that her father-in-law 's peopl must have treat this forlorn widow abomin , if she could bear it no longer , and was driven to take refug with him . as she had neither father nor mother , how could he desert her ? so say , he let the matter drop , far he had no mind to distress kadambini by ask her unpleas question . his wife , then , tri other mean of her sluggish lord , until at last he saw that for the sake of peac he must send word to kadambini father-in-law . the result of a letter , he thought , might not be satisfactori ; so he resolv to go to ranihat , and act on what he learnt . so sripati went , and jogmaya on her part said to kadambini `` friend , it hard seem proper for you to stop here any longer . what will peopl say ? '' kadambini stare solemn at jogmaya , and said : `` what have i to do with peopl ? '' jogmaya was astound . then she said sharpli : `` if you have noth to do with peopl , we have . how can we explain the detent of a woman belong to anoth hous ? '' kadambini said : `` where is my father-in-law 's hous ? '' `` confound it ! '' thought jogmaya . `` what will the wretch woman say next ? '' very slowli kadambini said : `` what have i to do with you ? am i of the earth ? you laugh , weep , love ; each grip and hold his own ; i mere look . you are human , i a shadow . i can not understand why god has kept me in this world of yours . '' so strang were her look and speech that jogmaya understood someth of her drift , though not all . unabl either to dismiss her , or to ask her any more question , she went away , oppress with thought . iv it was near ten o'clock at night when sripati return from ranihat . the earth was drown in torrent of rain . it seem that the downpour would never stop , that the night would never end . jogmaya ask : `` well ? '' `` i ve lot to say , present . '' so say , sripati chang his cloth , and sat down to supper ; then he lay dawn for a smoke . his mind was perplex . his wife still her curios for a long time ; then she came to his couch and demand : `` what did you hear ? '' `` that you have certain made a mistak . '' jogmaya was nettl . women never make mistak , or , if they do , a sensibl man never mention them ; it is better to take them on his own shoulder . jogmaya snap : `` may i be permit to hear how ? '' sripati repli : `` the woman you have taken into your hous is not your kadambini . '' hear this , she was great annoy , especi sinc it was her husband who said it . `` what ! i do n't know my own friend ? i must come to you to recognis her ! you are clever , inde ! '' sripati explain that there was no need to quarrel about his clever . he could prove what he said . there was no doubt that jogmaya 's kadambini was dead . jogmaya repli : `` listen ! you ve certain made some huge mistak . you ve been to the wrong hous , or are confus as to what you have heard . who told you to go yourself ? write a letter , and everyth will be clear up . '' sripati was hurt by his wife 's lack of faith in his execut abil ; he produc all sort of proof , without result . midnight found them still assert and contradict . although they were both agre now that kadambini should be got out of the hous , although sripati believ that their guest had deceiv his wife all the time by a pretend acquaint , and jogmaya that she was a prostitut , yet in the present discuss neither would acknowledg defeat . by degre their voic becam so loud that they forgot that kadambini was sleep in the next room . the one said : `` we re in a nice fix ! i tell you , i heard it with my own ear ! '' and the other answer angrili : `` what do i care about that ? i can see with my own eye , sure . '' at length jogmaya said : `` very well . tell me when kadambini die . '' she thought that if she could find a discrep between the day of death and the date of some letter from kadambini , she could prove that sripati er . he told her the date of kadambini 's death , and they both saw that it fell on the very day before she came to their hous . jogmaya 's heart trembl , even sripati was not unmov . just then the door flew open ; a damp wind swept in and blew the lamp out . the dark rush after it , and fill the whole hous . kadambini stood in the room . it was near one o'clock , the rain was pelt outsid . kadambini spoke : `` friend , i am your kadambini , but i am no longer live . i am dead . '' jogmaya scream with terror ; sripati could speak . `` but , save in being dead , i have done you no wrong . if i have no place among the live , i have none among the dead . oh ! whither shall i go ? '' cri as if to wake the sleep creator in the dens night of rain , she ask again : `` oh ! whither shall i go ? '' so say kadambini left her friend faint in the dark hous , and went out into the world , seek her own place . v it is hard to say how kadambini reach ranihat . at first she show herself to no one , but spent the whole day in a ruin templ , starv . when the untim afternoon of the rain was pitch-black , and peopl huddl into their hous for fear of the impend storm , then kadambini came forth . her heart trembl as she reach her father-in-law 's hous ; and when , draw a thick veil over her face , she enter , none of the doorkeep object , sinc they took her for a servant . and the rain was pour down , and the wind howl . the mistress , saradasankar 's wife , was play card with her widow sister . a servant was in the kitchen , the sick child was sleep in the bedroom . kadambini , escap everi one 's notic , enter this room . i do not know why she had come to her father-in-law 's hous ; she herself did not know ; she felt only that she want to see her child again . she had no thought where to go next , or what to do . in the light room she saw the child sleep , his fist clench , his bodi wast with fever . at sight of him , her heart becam parch and thirsti . if only she could press that tortur bodi to her breast ! immedi the thought follow : `` i do not exist . who would see it ? his mother love compani , love gossip and card . all the time that she left me in charg , she was herself free from anxieti , nor was she troubl about him in the least . who will look after him now as i did ? '' the child turn on his side , and cri , half-asleep : `` aunti , give me water . '' her darl had not yet forgotten his aunti ! in a fever of excit , she pour out some water , and , take him to her breast , she gave it him . as long as he was asleep , the child felt no strang in take water from the accustom hand . but when kadambini satisfi her long-starv long , and kiss him and began rock him asleep again , he awok and embrac her . `` did you die , aunti ? '' he ask . `` yes , darl . '' `` and you have come back ? do not die again . '' before she could answer disast overtook her . one of the maidserv come in with a cup of sago drop it , and fell down . at the crash the mistress left her card , and enter the room . she stood like a pillar of wood , unabl to flee or speak . see all this , the child , too , becam terrifi , and burst out weep : `` go away , aunti , '' he said , `` go away ! '' now at last kadambini understood that she had not die . the old room , the old thing , the same child , the same love , all return to their live state , without chang or differ between her and them . in her friend 's hous she had felt that her childhood 's companion was dead . in her child 's room she knew that the boy 's `` aunti '' was not dead at all . in anguish tone she said : `` sister , why do you dread me ? see , i am as you knew me . '' her sister-in-law could endur no longer , and fell into a faint . saradasankar himself enter the zenana . with fold hand , he said piteous : `` is this right ? sati is my only son . why do you show yourself to him ? are we not your own kin ? sinc you went , he has wast away daili ; his fever has been incess ; day and night he cri : aunti , aunti . ' you have left the world ; break these bond of maya ( illusori affect bind a soul to the world ) . we will perform all funer honour . '' kadambini could bear no more . she said : `` oh , i am not dead , i am not dead . oh , how can i persuad you that i am not dead ? i am live , live ! '' she lift a brass pot from the ground and dash it against her forehead . the blood ran from her brow . `` look ! '' she cri , `` i am live ! '' saradasankar stood like an imag ; the child scream with fear , the two faint women lay still . then kadambini , shout `` i am not dead , i am not dead , '' went down the step to the zenana well , and plung in . from the upper storey saradasankar heard the splash . all night the rain pour ; it pour next day at dawn , was pour still at noon . by die , kadambini had given proof that she was not dead . `` we crown thee king '' when nabendu sekhar was wed to arunlekha , the god of marriag smile from behind the sacrifici fire . ala ! what is sport for the god is not alway a joke to us poor mortal . purnendu sekhar , the father of nabendu , was a man well known amongst the english offici of the govern . in the voyag of life he had arriv at the desert shore of rai bahadurship by dilig pli his oat of salaam . he held in reserv enough for further advanc , but at the age of fifty-f , his tender gaze still fix on the misti peal of raja-hood , he sudden found himself transport to a region where earth honour and decor are naught , and his salaam-weari neck found everlast repos on the funer pyre . accord to modern scienc , forc is not destroy , but is mere convert to anoth form , and appli to anoth point . so purnendu salaam-forc , constant handmaid of the fickl goddess of fortun , descend from the shoulder of the father to that of his worthi son ; and the youth head of nabendu sekhar began to move up and down , at the door of high-plac englishmen , like a pumpkin sway by the wind . the tradit of the famili into which he had marri were entir differ . its eldest son , pramathanath , had won for himself the love of his kinsfolk and the regard of all who knew him . his kinsmen and his neighbour look up to him as their ideal in all thing . pramathanath was a bachelor of art , and in addit was gift with common sens . but he held no high offici posit ; he had no handsom salari ; nor did he exert any influenc with his pen . there was no one in power to lend him a help hand , because he desir to keep away from englishmen , as much as they desir to keep away from him . so it happen that he shone only within the sphere of his famili and his friend , and excit no admir beyond it . yet this pramathanath had once sojourn in england for some three year . the kind treatment he receiv during his stay there overpow him so much that he forgot the sorrow and the humili of his own countri , and came back dress in european cloth . this rather griev his brother and his sister at first , but after a few day they began to think that european cloth suit nobodi better , and gradual they came to share his pride and digniti . on his return from england , pramathanath resolv that he would show the world how to associ with anglo-indian on term of equal . those of our countrymen who think that no such associ is possibl , unless we bend our knee to them , show their utter lack of self-respect , and were also unjust to the english-so thought pramathanath . he brought with him letter of introduct from mani distinguish englishmen at home , and these gave him some recognit in anglo-indian societi . he and his wife occasion enjoy english hospit at tea , dinner , sport and other entertain . such good luck intox him , and began to produc a tingl sensat in everi vein of his bodi . about this time , at the open of a new railway line , mani of the town , proud recipi of offici favour , were invit by the lieutenant-governor to take the first trip . pramathanath was among them . on the return journey , a european sergeant of the polic expel some indian gentlemen from a railway-carriag with great insol . pramathanath , dress in his european cloth , was there . he , too , was get out , when the sergeant said : `` you need n't move , sir . keep your seat , pleas . '' at first pramathanath felt flatter at the special respect thus shown to him . when , howev , the train went on , the dull ray of the set sun , at the west of the field , now plough up and strip of green , seem in his eye to spread a glow of shame over the whole countri . sit near the window of his lone compart , he seem to catch a glimps of the down-cast eye of his motherland , hidden behind the tree . as pramathanath sat there , lost in reveri , burn tear flow down his cheek , and his heart burst with indign . he now rememb the stori of a donkey who was draw the chariot of an idol along the street . the wayfar bow down to the idol , and touch the dusti ground with their forehead . the foolish donkey imagin that all this rever was being shown to him . `` the only differ , '' said pramathanath to himself , `` between the donkey and myself is this : i understand to-day that the respect i receiv is not given to me but to the burden on my back . '' arriv home , pramathanath call togeth all the children of the household , and light a big bonfir , threw all his european cloth into it one by one . the children danc round and round it , and the higher the flame shot up , the greater was their merriment . after that , pramathanath gave up his sip of tea and bit of toast in anglo-indian hous , and once again sat inaccess within the castl of his hous , while his insult friend went about from the door of one englishman to that of anoth , bend their turban head as before . by an ironi of fate , poor nabendu sekhar marri the second daughter of this hous . his sisters-in-law were well educ and handsom . nabendu consid he had made a lucki bargain . but he lost no time in tri to impress on the famili that it was a rare bargain on their side also . as if by mistak , he would often hand to his sisters-in-law sundri letter that his late father had receiv from european . and when the cherri lip of those young ladi smile sarcast , and the point of a shine dagger peep out of its sheath of red velvet , the unfortun man saw his folli , and regret it . labanyalekha , the eldest sister , surpass the rest in beauti and clever . find an auspici day , she put on the mantel-shelf of nabendu 's bedroom two pair of english boot , daub with vermilion , and arrang flower , sandal-past , incens and a coupl of burn candl before them in true ceremoni fashion . when nabendu came in , the two sisters-in-law stood on either side of him , and said with mock solemn : `` bow down to your god , and may you prosper through their bless . '' the third sister kiranlekha spent mani day in embroid with red silk one hundr common english name such as jone , smith , brown , thomson , etc. , on a chadar . when it was readi , she present this namavoli ( a namavoli is a sheet of cloth print all over with the name of hindu god and goddess and worn by pious hindus when engag in devot exercis . ) to nabendu sekhar with great ceremoni . the fourth , sasankalekha , of tender age and therefor of no account , said : `` i will make you a string of bead , brother , with which to tell the name of your gods-th sahib . '' her sister reprov her , say : '' run away , you sauci girl . '' feel of shame and irrit assail by turn the mind of nabendu sekhar . still he could not forego the compani of his sisters-in-law , especi as the eldest one was beauti . her honey was no less than her gall , and nabendu 's mind tast at once the sweet of the one and the bitter of the other . the butterfli , with its bruis wing , buzz round the flower in blind furi , unabl to depart . the societi of his sisters-in-law so much infatu him that at last nabendu began to disavow his crave for european favour . when he went to salaam the burra sahib , he use to pretend that he was go to listen to a speech by mr. surendranath banerjea . when he went to the railway station to pay respect to the chota sahib , return from darjeel , he would tell his sisters-in-law that he expect his youngest uncl . it was a sore trial to the unhappi man place between the cross-fir of his sahib and his sisters-in-law . the sisters-in-law , howev , secret vow that they would not rest till the sahib had been put to rout . about this time it was rumour that nabendu 's name would be includ in the forthcom list of birthday honour , and that he would mount the first step of the ladder to paradis by becom a rai bahadur . the poor fellow had not the courag to break the joy news to his sisters-in-law . one even , howev , when the autumn moon was flood the earth with its mischiev beam , nabendu 's heart was so full that he could not contain himself any longer , and he told his wife . the next day , mrs. nabendu betook herself to her eldest sister 's hous in a palanquin , and in a voic choke with tear bewail her lot . `` he is n't go to grow a tail , '' said labanya , `` by becom a rai bahadur , is he ? why should you feel so very humili ? '' `` oh , no , sister dear , '' repli arunlekha , `` i am prepar to be anyth -- but not a rai-baha-durni . '' the fact was that in her circl of acquaint there was one bhutnath babu , who was a rai bahadur , and that explain her intens avers to that titl . labanya said to her sister in sooth tone : `` do n't be upset about it , dear ; i will see what i can do to prevent it . '' babu nilratan , the husband of labanya , was a pleader at buxar . when the autumn was over , nabendu receiv an invit from labanya to pay them a visit , and he start for buxar great pleas . the earli winter of the western provinc endow labanyalekha with new health and beauti , and brought a glow colour to her pale cheek , she look like the flower-laden kasa reed on a clear autumn day , grow by the lone bank of a rivulet . to nabendu 's enchant eye she appear like a malati plant in full blossom , shower dew-drop brilliant with the morn light . nabendu had never felt better in his life . the exhilar of his own health and the genial compani of his pretti sister-in-law made him think himself light enough to tread on air . the gang in front of the garden seem to him to be flow ceaseless to region unknown , as though it gave shape to his own wild fantasi . as he return in the earli morn from his walk on the bank of the river , the mellow ray of the winter sun gave his whole frame that pleas sensat of warmth which lover feel in each other 's arm . come home , he would now and then find his sister-in-law amus herself by cook some dish . he would offer his help , and display his want of skill and ignor at everi step . but nabendu did not appear to be at all anxious to improv himself by practic and attent . on the contrari he thorough enjoy the rebuk he receiv from his sister-in-law . he was at great pain to prove everi day that he was ineffici and helpless as a new-born babe in mix spice , handl the saucepan , and regul the heat so as to prevent thing get burnt-and he was duli reward with piti smile and scold . in the middl of the day he ate a great deal of the good food set before him , incit by his keen appetit and the coax of his sister-in-law . later on , he would sit down to a game of card -- at which he betray the same lack of abil . he would cheat , pri into his adversari 's hand , quarrel -- but never did he win a singl rubber , and wors still , he would not acknowledg defeat . this brought him abus everi day , and still he remain incorrig . there was , howev , one matter in which his reform was complet . for the time at least , he had forgotten that to win the smile of sahib was the final goal of life . he was begin to understand how happi and worthi we might feel by win the affect and esteem of those near and dear to us . besid , nabendu was now move in a new atmospher . labanya 's husband , babu nilratan , a leader of the bar , was reproach by mani because he refus to pay his respect to european offici . to all such reproach nilratan would repli : `` no , thank you , -- if they are not polit enough to return my call , then the polit i offer them is a loss that can never be made up for . the sand of the desert may be very white and shini , but i would much rather sow my seed in black soil , where i can expect a return . '' and nabendu began to adopt similar idea , all regardless of the futur . his chanc of rai bahadurship throve on the soil care prepar by his late father and also by himself in day gone by , nor was any fresh water requir . had he not at great expens laid out a splendid race-cours in a town , which was a fashion resort of european ? when the time of congress drew near , nilratan receiv a request from head-quart to collect subscript . nabendu , free from anxieti , was merrili engag in a game of card with his sister-in-law , when nilratan babu came upon him with a subscription-book in his hand , and said : `` your signatur , pleas . '' from old habit nabendu look horrifi . labanya , assum an air of great concern and anxieti , said : `` never do that . it would ruin your racecours beyond repair . '' nabendu blurt out : `` do you suppos i pass sleepless night through fear of that ? '' `` we wo n't publish your name in the paper , '' said nilratan reassur . labanya , look grave and anxious , said : `` still , it would n't be safe . thing spread so , from mouth to mouth -- '' nabendu repli with vehem : `` my name would n't suffer by appear in the newspap . '' so say , he snatch the subscript list from nilratan 's hand , and sign away a thousand rupe . secret he hope that the paper would not publish the news . labanya struck her forehead with her palm and gasp out : `` what -- have you -- done ? '' `` noth wrong , '' said nabendu boast . `` but -- but -- , '' drawl labanya , `` the guard sahib of sealdah station , the shop-assist at whiteaway 's , the syce-sahib of hart bros. -- these gentlemen might be angri with you , and declin to come to your poojah dinner to drink your champagn , you know . just think , they might n't pat you on the back , when you meet them again ! '' `` it would n't break my heart , '' nabendu snap out . a few day pass . one morn nabendu was sip his tea , and glanc at a newspap . sudden a letter sign `` x '' caught his eye . the writer thank him profus for his donat , and declar that the increas of strength the congress had acquir by having such a man within its fold , was inestim . ala , father purnendu sekhar ! was it to increas the strength of the congress , that you brought this wretch into the world ? put the cloud of misfortun had its silver line . that he was not a mere cypher was clear from the fact that the anglo-indian communiti on the one side and the congress on the other were each wait patient , eager to hook him , and land him on their own side . so nabendu , beam with pleasur took the paper to his sister-in-law , and show her the letter . look as though she knew noth about it , labanya exclaim in surpris : `` oh , what a piti ! everyth has come out ! who bore you such ill-wil ? oh , how cruel of him , how wick of him ! '' nabendu laugh out , say : `` now -- now -- do n't call him name , labanya . i forgiv him with all my heart , and bless him too . '' a coupl of day after this , an anti-congress anglo-indian paper reach nabendu through the post . there was a letter in it , sign `` one who know , '' and contradict the above report . `` those who have the pleasur of babu nabendu sekhar 's person acquaint , '' the writer went on , '' can not for a moment believ this absurd libel to be true . for him to turn a congresswalla is as imposs as it is for the leopard to chang his spot . he is a man of genuin worth , and neither a disappoint candid for govern employ nor a briefless barrist . he is not one of those who , after a brief sojourn in england , return ape our dress and manner , audaci tri to thrust themselves on anglo-indian societi , and final go back in deject . so there is absolut no reason why balm nabendu sekhar , '' etc. , etc . ah , father purnendu sekhar ! what a reput you had made with the european before you die ! this letter also was parad before his sister-in-law , for did it not assert that he was no mean , contempt scallywag , but a man of real worth ? labanya exclaim again in feign surpris : `` which of your friend wrote it now ? oh , come -- is it the ticket collector , or the hide merchant , or is it the drum-major of the fort ? '' `` you ought to send in a contradict , i think , '' said nilratan . `` is it necessari ? '' said nabendu loftili . `` must i contradict everi littl thing they choos to say against me ? '' labanya fill the room with a delug of laughter . nabendu felt a littl disconcert at this , and said : `` why ? what 's the matter ? '' she went on laugh , unabl to check herself , and her youth slender form wave to and fro . this torrent of merriment had the effect of overthrow nabendu complet , and he said in pitiabl accent : `` do you imagin that i am afraid to contradict it ? '' `` oh , dear , no , '' said labanya ; `` i was think that you have n't yet ceas tri to save that race-cours of yours , so full of promis . while there is life , there is hope , you know . '' `` that 's what i am afraid of , you think , do you ? very well , you shall see , '' said nabendu desper , and forthwith sat down to write his contradict . when he had finish , labanya and nilratan read it through , and said : `` it is n't strong enough . we must give it them pretti hot , must n't we ? '' and they kind undertook to revis the composit . thus it ran : `` when one connect to us by tie of blood turn our enemi he becom far more danger than any outsid . to the govern of india , the haughti anglo-indian are wors enemi than the russian or the frontier pathan themselves -- they are the impenetr barrier , forev hinder the growth of any bond of friendship between the govern and peopl of the countri . it is the congress which has open up the royal road to a better understand between the ruler and the rule , and the anglo-indian paper have plant themselves like thorn across the whole breadth of that road , '' etc. , etc . nabendu had an inward fear as to the mischief this letter might do , but at the same time he felt elat at the excel of its composit , which he fond imagin to be his own . it was duli publish , and for some day comment , repli , and rejoind went on in various newspap , and the air was full of trumpet-not , proclaim the fact that nabendu had join the congress , and the amount of his subscript . nabendu , now grown desper , talk as though he was a patriot of the fiercest type . labanya laugh inward , and said to herself : '' well -- -well -- you have to pass through the ordeal of fire yet . '' one morn when nabendu , before his bath , had finish rub oil over his chest , and was tri various devic to reach the inaccess portion of his back , the bearer brought in a card inscrib with the name of the district magistr himself ! good heaven ! -- what would he do ? he could not possibl go , and receiv the magistr sahib , thus oil-besmear . he shook and twitch like a koi-fish , readi dress for the fri pan . he finish his bath in a great hurri , tug on his cloth somehow , and ran breathless to the outer apart . the bearer said that the sahib had just left after wait for a long time . how much of the blame for concoct this drama of invent incid may be set down to labanya , and how much to the bearer is a nice problem for ethic mathemat to solv . nabendu 's heart was convuls with pain within his breast , like the tail of a lizard just cut off . he mope like an owl all day long . labanya banish all trace of inward merriment from her face , and kept on enquir in anxious tone : `` what has happen to you ? you are not ill , i hope ? '' nabendu made great effort to smile , and find a humor repli . `` how can there be , '' he manag to say , `` any ill within your jurisdict , sinc you yourself are the goddess of health ? '' but the smile soon flicker out . his thought were : `` i subscrib to the congress fund to begin with , publish a nasti letter in a newspap , and on the top of that , when the magistr sahib himself did me the honour to call on me , i kept him wait . i wonder what he is think of me . '' ala , father purnendu sekhar , by an ironi of fate i am made to appear what i am not . the next morn , nabendu deck himself in his best cloth , wore his watch and chain , and put a big turban on his head . `` where are you off to ? '' enquir his sister-in-law . `` urgent busi , '' nabendu repli . labanya kept quiet . arriv at the magistr 's gate , he took out his card-cas . `` you can not see him now , '' said the order peon icili . nabendu took out a coupl of rupe from his pocket . the peon at once salaam him and said : `` there are five of us , sir . '' immedi nabendu pull out a ten-rupe note , and hand it to him . he was sent for by the magistr , who was write in his dressing-gown and bedroom slipper . nabendu salaam him . the magistr point to a chair with his finger , and without rais his eye from the paper before him said : `` what can i do for you , babu ? '' finger his watch-chain nervous , nabendu said is shaki tone : '' yesterday you were good enough to call at my place , sir -- '' the sahib knit his brow , and , lift just one eye from his paper , said : `` i call at your place ! babu , what nonsens are you talk ? '' `` beg your pardon , sir , '' falter out nabendu . `` there has been a mistak -- some confus , '' and wet with perspir , he tumbl out of the room somehow . and that night , as he lay toss on his bed , a distant dream-lik voic came into his ear with a recur persist : '' babu , you are a howl idiot . '' on his way home , nabendu came to the conclus that the magistr deni having call , simpli because he was high offend . so he explain to labanya that he had been out purchas rose-wat . no sooner had he utter the word than half-a-dozen chuprassi wear the collector badg made their appear , and after salaam nabendu , stood there grin . `` have they come to arrest you because you subscrib to the congress fund ? '' whisper labanya with a smile . the six peon display a dozen row of teeth and said : '' bakshish -- babu-sahib . '' from a side room nilratan came out , and said in an irrit manner : '' bakshish ? what for ? '' the peon , grin as before , answer : `` the babu-sahib went to see the magistr -- so we have come for bakshish . '' `` i did n't know , '' laugh out labanya , `` that the magistr was sell rose-wat nowaday . cool was n't the special featur of his trade before . '' nabendu in tri to reconcil the stori of his purchas with his visit to the magistr , utter some incoher word , which nobodi could make sens of . nilratan spoke to the peon : `` there has been no occas for bakshish ; you sha n't have it . '' nabendu said , feel very small : `` oh , they are poor men -- what the harm of give them someth ? '' and he took out a currenc note . nilratan snatch it way from nabendu 's hand , remark : `` there are poorer men in the world -- i will give it to them for you . '' nabendu felt great distress that he was not abl to appeas these ghost retain of the angri siva . when the peon were leav , with thunder in their eye , he look at them languish , as much as to say : `` you know everyth , gentlemen , it is not my fault . '' the congress was to be held at calcutta this year . nilratan went down thither with his wife to attend the sit . nabendu accompani them . as soon as they arriv at calcutta , the congress parti surround nabendu , and their delight and enthusiasm knew no bound . they cheer him , honour him , and extol him up to the sky . everybodi said that , unless lead men like nabendu devot themselves to the caus , there was no hope for the countri . nabendu was dispos to agre with them , and emerg out of the chao of mistak and confus as a leader of the countri . when he enter the congress pavilion on the first day , everybodi stood up , and shout `` hip , hip , hurrah , '' in a loud outlandish voic , hear which our motherland redden with shame to the root of her ear . in due time the queen 's birthday came , and nabendu 's name was not found in the list of rai bahadur . he receiv an invit from labanya for that even . when he arriv there , labanya with great pomp and ceremoni present him with a robe of honour , and with her own hand put a mark of red sandal past on the middl of his forehead . each of the other sister threw round his neck a garland of flower woven by herself . deck in a pink sari and dazzl jewel , his wife arunlekha was wait in a side room , her face lit up with smile and blush . her sister rush to her , and , place anoth garland in her hand , insist that she also should come , and do her part in the ceremoni , but she would not listen to it ; and that princip garland , cherish a desir for nabendu 's neck , wait patient for the still secreci of midnight . the sister said to nabendu : `` to-day we crown thee king . such honour will not be done to any bodi els in hindoostan . '' whether nabendu deriv any consol from this , he alon can tell ; but we great doubt it . we believ , in fact , that he will becom a rai bahadur before he has done , and the englishman and the pioneer will write heart-rend articl lament his demis at the proper time . so , in the meanwhil , three cheer for babu purnendu sekhar ! hip , hip , hurrah -- hip , hip , hurrah -- hip , hip , hurrah . the renunci i it was a night of full moon earli in the month of phalgun . the youth spring was everywher send forth its breez laden with the fragranc of mango-blossom . the melodi note of an untir papiya ( one of the sweetest songster in bengal . anglo-indian writer have nicknam it the '' brain-fev bird , '' which is a sheer libel . ) , conceal within the thick foliag of an old lichi tree by the side of a tank , penetr a sleepless bedroom of the mukerji famili . there hemanta now restless twist a lock of his wife 's hair round his finger , now beat her churl against her wristlet until it tinkl , now pull at the chaplet of flower about her head , and left it hang over hex face . his mood was that of as even breez which play about a favourit flower shrub , gentl shake her now this side , now that , in the hope of rous her to anim . but kusum sat motionless , look out of the open window , with eye immers in the moonlit depth of never-end space beyond . her husband 's caress were lost on her . at last hemanta clasp both the hand of his wife , and , shake them gentl , said : `` kusum , where are you ? a patient search through a big telescop would reveal you only as a small speck-you seem to have reced so far away . o , do come closer to me , dear . see how beauti the night is . '' kusum turn her eye from the void of space toward her husband , and said slowli : `` i know a mantra ( a set of magic word . ) , which could in one moment shatter this spring night and the moon into piec . '' `` if you do , '' laugh hemanta , `` pray do n't utter it . if any mantra of yours could bring three or four saturday during the week , and prolong the night till 5 p.m. the next day , say it by all mean . '' say this , he tri to draw his wife a littl closer to him . kusum , free herself from the embrac , said : `` do you know , to-night i feel a long to tell you what i promis to reveal only on my death-b . to-night i feel that i could endur whatev punish you might inflict on me . '' hemanta was on the point of make a jest about punish by recit a vers from jayadeva , when the sound of an angri pair of slipper was heard approach rapid . they were the familiar footstep of his father , haribar mukerji , and hemanta , not know what it meant , was in a flutter of excit . stand outsid the door harihar roar out : `` hemanta , turn your wife out of the hous immedi . '' hemanta look at his wife , and detect no trace of surpris in her featur . she mere buri her face within the palm of her hand , and , with all the strength and intens of her soul , wish that she could then and there melt into nothing . it was the same papiya whose song float into the room with the south breez , and no one heard it . endless are the beauti of the earth-but ala , how easili everyth is twist out of shape . ii return from without , hemanta ask his wife : `` is it true ?

'' kusum grave told her stori in a firm unshaken voic . she wade barefoot through fire , as it were , with slow unflinch step , and nobodi knew how much she was scorch . having heard her to the end , hemanta rose and walk out . kusum thought that her husband had gone , never to return to her again . it did not strike her as strang . she took it as natur as any other incid of everyday life-so dri and apathet had her mind becom during the last few moment . only the world and love seem to her as a void and make-believ from begin to end . even the memori of the protest of love , which her husband had made to her in day past , brought to her lip a dri , hard , joyless smile , like a sharp cruel knife which had cut through her heart . she was think , perhap , that the love which seem to fill so much of one 's life , which brought in its train such fond and depth of feel , which made even the briefest separ so exquisit pain and a moment 's union so intens sweet , which seem boundless in its extent and etern in its durat , the cessat of which could not be imagin even in birth to come -- that this was that love ! so feebl was its support ! no sooner does the priesthood touch it than your `` etern '' love crumbl into a hand of dust ! only a short while ago hemanta had whisper to her : `` what a beauti night ! '' the same night was not yet at an end , the same yapiya was still warbl , the same south breez still blew into the roam , make the bed-curtain shiver ; the same moonlight lay on the bed next the open window , sleep like a beauti heroin exhaust with gaieti . all this was unreal ! love was more fals dissembl than she herself ! iii the next morn hemanta , fag after a sleepless night , and look like one distract , call at the hous of peari sankar ghosal . `` what news , my son ? '' peari sankar greet him . hemanta , flare up like a big fire , said in a trembl voic : `` you have defil our cast . you have brought destruct upon us . and you will have to pay for it .

'' said peari sankar with a slight sarcast smile . hemanta wish that his brahmin-furi could reduc peari sankar to ash in a moment , but his rage burnt only himself . peari sankar sat before him unscath , and in the best of health . `` did i ever do you any harm ? '' demand hemanta in a broken voic . `` let me ask you one question , '' said peari sankar . `` my daughter -- my only child-what harm had she done your father ? you were very young then , and probabl never heard . listen , then . now , do n't you excit yourself . there is much humour in what i am go to relat . `` you were quit small when my son-in-law nabakanta ran away to england after steal my daughter 's jewel . you might truli rememb the commot in the villag when he return as a barrist five year later . or , perhap , you were unawar of it , as you were at school in calcutta at the time . your father , arrog to himself the headship of the communiti , declar that if i sent my daughter to her husband home , i must renounc her for good , and never again allow her to cross my threshold . i fell at your father 's feet , and implor him , say : brother , save me this once . i will make the boy swallow cow-dung , and go through the prayaschittam ceremoni . do take him back into cast . ' but your father remain obdur . for my part , i could not disown my only child , and , bid good-by to my villag and my kinsmen , i betook myself to calcutta . there , too , my troubl follow me . when i had made everi arrang for my nephew 's marriag , your father stir up the girl 's peopl , and they broke the match off . then i took a solemn vow that , if there was a drop of brahmin blood flow in my vein , i would aveng myself . you understand the busi to some extent now , don't you ? but wait a littl longer . you will enjoy it , when i tell you the whole stori ; it is interest . `` when you were attend colleg , one biprada chatterji use to live next door to your lodg . the poor fellow is dead now . in his hous live a child-widow call kusum , the destitut orphan of a kayestha gentleman . the girl was very pretti , and the old brahmin desir to shield her from the hungri gaze of colleg student . but for a young girl to throw dust in the eye of her old guardian was not at all a difficult task . she often went to the top of the roof , to hang her wash out to dri , and , i believ , you found your own roof best suit for your studi . whether you two spoke to each other , when on your respect roof , i can not tell , but the girl 's behaviour excit suspicion in the old man 's mind . she made frequent mistak in her household duti , and , like parbati ( the wife of shiva the destroy ) , engag in her devot , began gradual to renounc food and sleep . some even she would burst into tear in the presenc of the old gentleman , without any appar reason . `` at last he discov that you two saw each other from the roof pretti frequent , and that you even went the length of absent yourself from colleg to sit on the roof at mid-day with a book in your hand , so fond had you grown sudden of solitari studi . biprada came to me for advic , and told me everyth . uncl , ' said i to him , for a long while you have cherish a desir to go on a pilgrimag to benar . you had better do it now , and leav the girl in my charg . i will take care of her . ' `` so he went . i lodg the girl in the hous of sripati chatterji , pass him off as her father . what happen next is known to you . i feel a great relief to-day , having told you everyth from the begin . it sound like a romanc , does n't it ? i think of turn it into a book , and get it print . but i am not a writing-man myself . they say my nephew has some aptitud that way -- i will get him to write it for me . but the best thing would be , if you would collabor with him , because the conclus of the stori is not known to me so well . '' without pay much attent to the conclud remark of peari sankar , hemanta ask : `` did not kusum object to this marriag ? '' `` well , '' said peari sankar , `` it is very difficult to guess . you know , my boy , how women 's mind are constitut . when they say no , ' they mean yes . ' during the first few day after her remov to the new home , she went almost crazi at not see you . you , too , seem to have discov her new address somehow , as you use to lose your way after start for colleg , and loiter about in front of sripati 's hous . your eye did not appear to be exact in search of the presid colleg , as they were direct toward the bar window of a privat hous , through which noth but insect and the heart of moon-struck young men could obtain access . i felt very sorri for you both . i could see that your studi were being serious interrupt , and that the plight of the girl was pitiabl also . `` one day i call kusum to me , and said : listen to me , my daughter . i am an old man , and you need feel no delicaci in my presenc . i know whom you desir at heart . the young man 's condit is hopeless too . i wish i could bring about your union . ' at this kusum sudden melt into tear , and ran away . on sever even after that , i visit sripati 's hous , and , call kusum to me , discuss with her matter relat to you , and so i succeed in gradual overcom her shyness . at last , when i said that i would tri to bring about a marriag , she ask me : how can it be ? ' never mind , ' i said , ' i would pass you off as a brahmin maiden . ' after a good deal of argument , she beg me to find out whether you would approv of it . what nonsens , ' repli i , the boy is well-nigh mad as it were , what 's the use of disclos all these complic to him ? let the ceremoni be over smooth and then -- all well that end well . especi , as there is not the slightest risk of its ever leak out , why go out of the way to make a fellow miser for life ? ' `` i do not know whether the plan had kusum 's assent or not . at time she wept , and at other time she remain silent . if i said , let us drop it then , ' she would becom very restless . when thing were in this state , i sent sripati to you with the propos of marriag ; you consent without a moment 's hesit . everyth was settl . `` short before the day fix , kusum becam so obstin that i had the greatest difficulti in bring her round again . do let it drop , uncl , ' she said to me constant . what do you mean , you silli child , ' i rebuk her , ' how can we back out now , when everyth has been settl ? ' `` spread a rumour that i am dead , ' she implor . send me away somewher . ' `` what would happen to the young man then ? ' said i . ' he is now in the seventh heaven of delight , expect that his long cherish desir would be fulfil to-morrow ; and to-day you want me to send him the news of your death . the result would be that to-morrow i should have to bear the news of his death to you , and the same even your death would be report to me . do you imagin , child , that i am capabl of commit a girl-murd and a brahmin-murd at my age ? ' `` eventu the happi marriag was celebr at the auspici moment , and i felt reliev of a burdensom duti which i owe to myself . what happen afterward you know best . '' `` could n't you stop after having done us an irrepar injuri ? '' burst out hemanta after a short silenc . `` why have you told the secret now ? '' with the utmost composur , peari sankar repli : `` when i saw that all arrang had been made for the wed of your sister , i said to myself : well , i have foul the cast of one brahmin , but that was only from a sens of duti . here , anoth brahmin 's cast is imperil , and this time it is my plain duti to prevent it . ' so i wrote to them say that i was in a posit to prove that you had taken the daughter of a sudra to wife . '' control himself with a gigant effort , hemanta said : `` what will becom of this girl whom i shall abandon now ? would you give her food and shelter ? '' `` i have done what was mine to do , '' repli peari sankar calm . `` it is no part of my duti to look after the discard wive of other peopl . anybodi there ? get a glass of cocoanut milk for hemanta babu with ice in it . and some pan too . '' hemanta rose , and took his departur without wait for this luxuri hospit . iv it was the fifth night of the wane of the moon -- and the night was dark . no bird were sing . the lichi tree by the tank look like a smudg of ink on a background a shade less deep . the south wind was blind roam about in the dark like a sleep-walk . the star in the sky with vigil unblink eye were tri to penetr the dark , in their effort to fathom some profound mysteri . no light shone in the bedroom . hemanta was sit on the side of the bed next the open window , gaze at the dark in front of him . kusum lay on the floor , clasp her husband 's feet with both her arm , and her face rest on them . time stood like an ocean hush into still . on the background of etern night , fate seem to have paint this one singl pictur for all time -- annihil on everi side , the judg in the centr of it , and the guilti one at his feet . the sound of slipper was heard again . approach the door , harihar mukerji said : `` you have had enough time , -- i ca n't allow you more . turn the girl out of the hous . '' kusum , as she heard this , embrac her husband 's feet with all the ardour of a lifetim , cover them with kiss , and touch her forehead to them reverenti , withdrew herself . hemanta rose , and walk to the door , said : `` father , i wo n't forsak my wife . '' `` what ! '' roar out harihar , `` would you lose your cast , sir ? '' `` i do n't care for cast , '' was hemanta 's calm repli . `` then you too i renounc . '' the cabuliwallah ( the fruitsel from cabul ) my five year ' old daughter mini can not live without chatter . i realli believ that in all her life she has not wast a minut in silenc . her mother is often vex at this , and would stop her prattl , but i would not . to see mini quiet is unnatur , and i can not bear it long . and so my own talk with her is alway live . one morn , for instanc , when i was in the midst of the seventeenth chapter of my new novel , my littl mini stole into the room , and put her hand into mine , said : `` father ! ramday the door-keep call a crow a krow ! he does n't know anyth , does he ? '' before i could explain to her the differ of languag in this world , she was embark on the full tide of anoth subject . `` what do you think , father ? bhola say there is an eleph in the cloud , blow water out of his trunk , and that is why it rain ! '' and then , dart off anew , while i sat still make readi some repli to this last say , `` father ! what relat is mother to you ? '' `` my dear littl sister in the law ! '' i murmur involuntarili to myself , but with a grave face contriv to answer : `` go and play with bhola , mini ! i am busi ! '' the window of my room overlook the road . the child had seat herself at my feet near my tabl , and was play soft , drum on her knee . i was hard at work on my seventeenth chapter , where protrap singh , the hero , had just caught kanchanlata , the heroin , in his arm , and was about to escap with her by the third stori window of the castl , when all of a sudden mini left her play , and ran to the window , cri , `` a cabuliwallah ! a cabuliwallah ! '' sure enough in the street below was a cabuliwallah , pass slowli along . he wore the loos soil cloth of his peopl , with a tall turban ; there was a bag on his back , and he carri box of grape in his hand . i can not tell what were my daughter 's feel at the sight of this man , but she began to call him loud . `` ah ! '' i thought , `` he will come in , and my seventeenth chapter will never be finish ! '' at which exact moment the cabuliwallah turn , and look up at the child . when she saw this , overcom by terror , she fled to her mother 's protect , and disappear . she had a blind belief that insid the bag , which the big man carri , there were perhap two or three other children like herself . the pedlar meanwhil enter my doorway , and greet me with a smile face . so precari was the posit of my hero and my heroin , that my first impuls was to stop and buy someth , sinc the man had been call . i made some small purchas , and a convers began about abdurrahman , the russian , she english , and the frontier polici . as he was about to leav , he ask : `` and where is the littl girl , sir ? '' and i , think that mini must get rid of her fals fear , had her brought out . she stood by my chair , and look at the cabuliwallah and his bag . he offer her nut and raisin , but she would not be tempt , and only clung the closer to me , with all her doubt increas . this was their first meet . one morn , howev , not mani day later , as i was leav the hous , i was startl to find mini , seat on a bench near the door , laugh and talk , with the great cabuliwallah at her feet . in all her life , it appear ; my small daughter had never found so patient a listen , save her father . and alreadi the corner of her littl sari was stuf with almond and raisin , the gift of her visitor , `` why did you give her those ? '' i said , and take out an eight-anna bit , i hand it to him . the man accept the money without demur , and slip it into his pocket . ala , on my return an hour later , i found the unfortun coin had made twice its own worth of troubl ! for the cabuliwallah had given it to mini , and her mother catch sight of the bright round object , had pounc on the child with : `` where did you get that eight-anna bit ? '' `` the cabuliwallah gave it me , '' said mini cheer . `` the cabuliwallah gave it you ! '' cri her mother much shock . `` oh , mini ! how could you take it from him ? '' i , enter at the moment , save her from impend disast , and proceed to make my own inquiri . it was not the first or second time , i found , that the two had met . the cabuliwallah had overcom the child 's first terror by a judici briberi of nut and almond , and the two were now great friend . they had mani quaint joke , which afford them much amus . seat in front of him , look down on his gigant frame in all her tini digniti , mini would rippl her face with laughter , and begin : `` o cabuliwallah , cabuliwallah , what have you got in your bag ? '' and he would repli , in the nasal accent of the mountain : `` an eleph ! '' not much caus for merriment , perhap ; but how they both enjoy the wittic ! and for me , this child 's talk with a grown-up man had alway in it someth strang fascin . then the cabuliwallah , not to be behindhand , would take his turn : `` well , littl one , and when are you go to the father-in-law 's hous ? '' now most small bengali maiden have heard long ago about the father-in-law 's hous ; but we , being a littl new-fangl , had kept these thing from our child , and mini at this question must have been a trifl bewild . but she would not show it , and with readi tact repli : `` are you go there ? '' amongst men of the cabuliwallah 's class , howev , it is well known that the word father-in-law 's hous have a doubl mean . it is a euphem for jail , the place where we are well care for , at no expens to ourselves . in this sens would the sturdi pedlar take my daughter question . `` ah , '' he would say , shake his fist at an invis policeman , `` i will thrash my father-in-law ! '' hear this , and pictur the poor discomfit relat , mini would go off into peal of laughter , in which her formid friend would join . these were autumn morn , the very time of year when king of old went forth to conquest ; and i , never stir from my littl corner in calcutta , would let my mind wander over the whole world . at the very name of anoth countri , my heart would go out to it , and at the sight of a foreign in the street , i would fall to weav a network of dream , -- the mountain , the glen , and the forest of his distant home , with his cottag in its set , and the free and independ life of far-away wild . perhap the scene of travel conjur themselves up before me , and pass and repass in my imagin all the more vivid , because i lead such a veget exist , that a call to travel would fall upon me like a thunderbolt . in the presenc of this cabuliwallah , i was immedi transport to the foot of arid mountain peak , with narrow littl defil twist in and out amongst their tower height . i could see the string of camel bear the merchandis , and the compani of turban merchant , carri some of their queer old firearm , and some of their spear , journey downward toward the plain . i could see -- but at some such point mini 's mother would interven , implor me to `` bewar of that man . '' mini 's mother is unfortun a very timid ladi . whenev she hear a nois in the street , or see peopl come toward the hous , she alway jump to the conclus that they are either thiev , or drunkard , or snake , or tiger , or malaria or cockroach , or caterpillar , or an english sailor . even after all these year of experi , she is not abl to overcom her terror . so she was full of doubt about the cabuliwallah , and use to beg me to keep a watch eye on him . i tri to laugh her fear gentl away , but then she would turn round on me serious , and ask me solemn question . were children never kidnap ? was it , then , not true that there was slaveri in cabul ? was it so very absurd that this big man should be abl to carri off a tini child ? i urg that , though not imposs , it was high improb . but this was not enough , and her dread persist . as it was indefinit , howev , it did not seem right to forbid the man the hous , and the intimaci went on uncheck . once a year in the middl of januari rahmun , the cabuliwallah , was in the habit of return to his countri , and as the time approach he would be very busi , go from hous to hous collect his debt . this year , howev , he could alway find time to come and see mini . it would have seem to an outsid that there was some conspiraci between the two , for when he could not come in the morn , he would appear in the even . even to me it was a littl startl now and then , in the corner of a dark room , sudden to surpris this tall , loose-gar , much bebag man ; but when mini would run in smile , with her , `` o ! cabuliwallah ! cabuliwallah ! '' and the two friend , so far apart in age , would subsid into their old laughter and their old joke , i felt reassur . one morn , a few day before he had made up his mind to go , i was correct my proof sheet in my studi . it was chilli weather . through the window the ray of the sun touch my feet , and the slight warmth was very welcom . it was almost eight o'clock , and the earli pedestrian were return home , with their head cover . all at once , i heard an uproar in the street , and , look out , saw rahmun being led away bound between two policemen , and behind them a crowd of curious boy . there were blood-stain on the cloth of the cabuliwallah , and one of the policemen carri a knife . hurri out , i stop them , and enquir what it all meant . part from one , part from anoth , i gather that a certain neighbour had owe the pedlar someth for a rampuri shawl , but had fals deni having bought it , and that in the cours of the quarrel , rahmun had struck him . now in the heat of his excit , the prison began call his enemi all sort of name , when sudden in a verandah of my hous appear my littl mini , with her usual exclam : `` o cabuliwallah ! cabuliwallah ! '' rahmun 's face light up as he turn to her . he had no bag under his arm today , so she could not discuss the eleph with him . she at once therefor proceed to the next question : `` are you go to the father-in-law 's hous ? '' rahmun laugh and said : `` just where i am go , littl one ! '' then see that the repli did not amus the child , he held up his fetter hand . `` ali , '' he said , `` i would have thrash that old father-in-law , but my hand are bound ! '' on a charg of murder assault , rahmun was sentenc to some year imprison . time pass away , and he was not rememb . the accustom work in the accustom place was ours , and the thought of the once-fre mountain spend his year in prison seldom or never occur to us . even my light-heart mini , i am asham to say , forgot her old friend . new companion fill her life . as she grew older , she spent more of her time with girl . so much time inde did she spend with them that she came no more , as she use to do , to her father 's room . i was scarc on speak term with her . year had pass away . it was once more autumn and we had made arrang for our mini 's marriag . it was to take place during the puja holiday . with durga return to kaila , the light of our home also was to depart to her husband 's hous , and leav her father 's in the shadow . the morn was bright . after the rain , there was a sens of ablut in the air , and the sun-ray look like pure gold . so bright were they that they gave a beauti radianc even to the sordid brick wall of our calcutta lane . sinc earli dawn to-day the wedding-pip had been sound , and at each beat my own heart throb . the wail of the tune , bhairavi , seem to intensifi my pain at the approach separ . my mini was to be marri to-night . from earli morn nois and bustl had pervad the hous . in the courtyard the canopi had to be slung on its bamboo pole ; the chandeli with their tinkl sound must be hung in each room and verandah . there was no end of hurri and excit . i was sit in my studi , look through the account , when some one enter , salut respect , and stood before me . it was rahmun the cabuliwallah . at first i did not recognis him . he had no bag , nor the long hair , nor the same vigour that he use to have . but he smile , and i knew him again . `` when did you come , rahmun ? '' i ask him . `` last even , '' he said , `` i was releas from jail . '' the word struck harsh upon my ear . i had never before talk with one who had wound his fellow , and my heart shrank within itself , when i realis this , for i felt that the day would have been better-omen had he not turn up . `` there are ceremoni go on , '' i said , `` and i am busi . could you perhap come anoth day ? '' at once he turn to go ; but as he reach the door he hesit , and said : `` may i not see the littl one , sir , for a moment ? '' it was his belief that mini was still the same . he had pictur her run to him as she use , call `` o cabuliwallah ! cabuliwallah ! '' he had imagin too that they would laugh and talk togeth , just as of old . in fact , in memori of former day he had brought , care wrap up in paper , a few almond and raisin and grape , obtain somehow from a countryman , for his own littl fund was dispers . i said again : `` there is a ceremoni in the hous , and you will not be abl to see any one to-day . '' the man 's face fell . he look wist at me for a moment , said `` good morn , '' and went out . i felt a littl sorri , and would have call him back , but i found he was return of his own accord . he came close up to me hold out his offer and said : `` i brought these few thing , sir , for the littl one . will you give them to her ? '' i took them and was go to pay him , but he caught my hand and said : '' you are very kind , sir ! keep me in your recollect . do not offer me money ! -- you have a littl girl , i too have one like her in my own home . i think of her , and bring fruit to your child , not to make a profit for myself . '' say this , he put his hand insid his big loos robe , and brought out a small and dirti piec of paper . with great care he unfold this , and smooth it out with both hand on my tabl . it bore the impress of a littl band . not a photograph . not a draw . the impress of an ink-smear hand laid flat on the paper . this touch of his own littl daughter had been alway on his heart , as he had come year after year to calcutta , to sell his ware in the street . tear came to my eye . i forgot that he was a poor cabuli fruit-sel , while i was -- but no , what was i more than he ? he also was a father . that impress of the hand of his littl parbati in her distant mountain home remind me of my own littl mini . i sent for mini immedi from the inner apart . mani difficulti were rais , but i would not listen . clad in the red silk of her wedding-day , with the sandal past on her forehead , and adorn as a young bride , mini came , and stood bash before me . the cabuliwallah look a littl stagger at the apparit . he could not reviv their old friendship . at last he smile and said : `` littl one , are you go to your father-in-law 's hous ? '' but mini now understood the mean of the word `` father-in-law , '' and she could not repli to him as of old . she flush up at the question , and stood before him with her bride-lik face turn down . i rememb the day when the cabuliwallah and my mini had first met , and i felt sad . when she had gone , rahmun heav a deep sigh , and sat down on the floor . the idea had sudden come to him that his daughter too must have grown in this long time , and that he would have to make friend with her anew . assur he would not find her , as he use to know her . and besid , what might not have happen to her in these eight year ? the marriage-pip sound , and the mild autumn sun stream round us . but rahmun sat in the littl calcutta lane , and saw before him the barren mountain of afghanistan . i took out a bank-not , and gave it to him , say : `` go back to your own daughter , rahmun , in your own countri , and may the happi of your meet bring good fortun to my child ! '' having made this present , i had to curtail some of the festiv . i could not have the electr light i had intend , nor the militari band , and the ladi of the hous were despond at it . but to me the wed feast was all the brighter for the thought that in a distant land a long-lost father met again with his only child . end of the project gutenberg ebook of the hungri stone and other stori , by
